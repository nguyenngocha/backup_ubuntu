[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.902 --> 00:00:08.440
Now along we've using else, and if
statements.

3
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.830
There's, some, occasions where you might
need to check multiple, different things.

4
00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.680
And that is easily possible within Python.

5
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.140
So we're going to set up the page again,
as we have done.

6
00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.100
For other, instances, and what we're gonna
do

7
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.090
here, actually instead of having it as
equal to,

8
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:34.189
we're going to do is greater than, and
we're going to print a is greater than b.

9
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:42.380
And then we are going to do else and this
is going to have print a is

10
00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:48.590
equal to a and now because obviously we
only have gray set and then equal

11
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:55.120
we also need to check if something is less
than so what we do now is Lif.

12
00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.510
And we do LFA as, if less then B.

13
00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.380
And then we have to print and A is less
than B.

14
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.760
Now what we do here is, if we print
[INAUDIBLE] we get the

15
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.820
output of A is less than B, because the
error is less than one.

16
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.360
Now if I change this to three, then we get
A is greater than, and if I

17
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:25.470
change this to one, then we get the A is
equal to b.

18
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.160
So, that is how an else if statement or an
EL if statement works is an

19
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:37.320
additional, Is an additional check for if
something is equal to something.

20
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.480
so, cuz you can only have one if statement
and one else

21
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.120
statement, cuz the else statement is
defined is treated as a default.

22
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.530
So if it can't bind anything that's trade,
then it prints out the else.

23
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:54.190
And the if is just what you use to
initialize this, code box to run.

24
00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.220
And so L if is what you, what you run
constantly throughout the rest of the.

25
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.380
Rest of the page.

26
00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.720
Now, this is identical to if you wanted to
do,

27
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.470
else, and then, you would have to do if,
within here.

28
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.170
However, it's recommended that you don't
do this, cuz it

29
00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.340
can get confusing as to how the code
blocker eventually works.

30
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.440
So, it's recommended that you do el if
instead.

31
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.820
Now you can have as many el if's as

32
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.670
you want, so if you had something where
you're checking

33
00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.670
a string, you could check as many strings
as you

34
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.290
wanted, with each one just having a
different el if.

35
00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.500
Now I, you could do something where if it
all had the same output

36
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.200
at the end, if it is true, then you do, if
something or something

37
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.480
or something or something or something,
and say well, you can do as many,

38
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.060
that way as well, however it's much more
readable to have it done with elifs.

39
00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.490
So, that is how an elif statement works,
thank

40
00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.926
you for watching and I will see you soon.

41
00:02:53.926 --> 00:02:59.064
