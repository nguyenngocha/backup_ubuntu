00:00:04.902 --> 00:00:06.268
Hello, and welcome back.

3
00:00:06.268 --> 00:00:08.658
Now, as you'd, expect if you're checking
if

4
00:00:08.658 --> 00:00:10.870
something is equal to something using the
if

5
00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.561
statement, there's also the opposite that
which is

6
00:00:13.561 --> 00:00:16.104
the else statement, so if something is not
true.

7
00:00:16.104 --> 00:00:18.546
Then there's something else which you can
run.

8
00:00:18.546 --> 00:00:23.802
So, if we're just going to set up a simple
page so a, b is equals to 0, 1.

9
00:00:23.802 --> 00:00:33.346
If a is equal to b [SOUND] then we're
going to run print, print true.

10
00:00:33.346 --> 00:00:36.691

11
00:00:36.691 --> 00:00:40.878
Now, what you do for else, is you just
simply type in the word else with a colon.

12
00:00:40.878 --> 00:00:43.314
And then we do print false.

13
00:00:43.314 --> 00:00:47.900
Now, an else statement is very simple, and
that is all that there is to it.

14
00:00:48.967 --> 00:00:52.950
And again, it creates a code block because
of the colon, so you can have as

15
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.300
many lines as you want in here as

16
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.720
long [UNKNOWN] it is indented by the same
amount.

17
00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.450
So, that's all there is to an if else
statement.

18
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.740
That is, an if and else statement.

19
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:08.993
So if you're confused by an if statement,
just go back and

20
00:01:08.993 --> 00:01:13.568
look at the previous video, and if you
think of constantly of it

21
00:01:13.568 --> 00:01:18.627
in your head, as being if something
doesn't happen, then something else

22
00:01:18.627 --> 00:01:22.842
must happen, that is the way we think of
an if else statement.

23
00:01:22.842 --> 00:01:26.753
So, thank you for watching this video and
I will see you in the next video.

24
00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:31.749
