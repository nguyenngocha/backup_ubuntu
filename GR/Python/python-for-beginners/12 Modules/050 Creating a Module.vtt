2
00:00:04.072 --> 00:00:08.420
Within python, every single script that we
create is going to be a module.

3
00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.809
Which means it can be imported into any
other file

4
00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:16.023
[COUGH], and an obvious purpose for this
would be, when I

5
00:00:16.023 --> 00:00:21.150
mentioned earlier, with object orientated
programming, when you're

6
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.380
extending something, you might want to
have each one in a different file.

7
00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.900
Each class in a different file, and that
will allow you to do that.

8
00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:31.750
The method I'm going to show you right now
is

9
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.830
just going to, not really do anything as
such, but

10
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.120
it will allow us, allow me to demonstrate
to you

11
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.110
how a mojo can be imported from what
you've created.

12
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.920
So, I got to files up here, one call
mojo.py, and one call save .py.

13
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.550
In save, we are not going to create

14
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.080
a class, we are just gonna create a
definition.

15
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.540
And this is just going to have a method
called hello.

16
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.030
And then that's just going to return, a
string hello.

17
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.620
So, it doesn't do anything of any
importance, of any value,

18
00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.960
but it allows me to demonstrate to you how
to work this.

19
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.680
And then if you do input, say, and if I
did a

20
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.960
print say dot, and you can see here that
we get the list,

21
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.950
of all of the available items showing.

22
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.440
So if I do say.hello, and run that, you
get hello outputted and that is

23
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:33.500
now importing the script say, into this
file now.

24
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.210
So that is how a module can be created and
used, and you

25
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.110
can have as many methods, you can have as
many variables as you want.

26
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.868
So I can do x equal to ten, and if I
choose this

27
00:01:43.868 --> 00:01:48.890
over here, to say .x, and run that, we get
a value ten.

28
00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:55.530
So, all of the attributes in which we have
accessible within our python script.

29
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.000
And we can access once we've imported that
script.

30
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.876
So, thank you for watching.

31
00:02:01.876 --> 00:02:07.209
