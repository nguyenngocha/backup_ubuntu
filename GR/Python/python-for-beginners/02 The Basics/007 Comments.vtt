00:00:04.568 --> 00:00:05.841
Hello, and welcome back.

3
00:00:05.841 --> 00:00:09.308
I'm Alex Bowers from learntoprogram.tv,
and in this video, we'll

4
00:00:09.308 --> 00:00:12.810
be covering how to add comments to your
page within Python.

5
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.820
So, comments are a very useful tool to
use, because it

6
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.120
will allow you to make your page more
readable to other people.

7
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.940
So if you were to share your code to
somebody else for assistance, for example.

8
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.640
Or to show them an example of how to do
something.

9
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.280
Using comments can be incredibly useful in
helping them

10
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.220
understand what parts of code, of your
code does what.

11
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.630
And also, if you were to come back to a
piece

12
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.740
of code which you wrote, say a year in the
past.

13
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.120
You'd be able to understand instantly what
it was you were writing.

14
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.930
And if you wrote it in a less efficient
way.

15
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.380
You'd be able to rewrite something to do
exact same thing.

16
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.200
As what your comments have specified,
you'll be trying to do.

17
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.980
And so it helps you considerably remember
what it is you were doing, and

18
00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.200
to help other people as well if you were
to share them, within your code.

19
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.030
And a comment is simply done with a

20
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.660
hash symbol inside a Python, so the hash
symbol.

21
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.630
On the Mac is Alt and then the 3 key.

22
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.981
On Windows, it's on the right-hand side
it's above

23
00:01:15.981 --> 00:01:19.208
the Shift key, it's just around above that
area there.

24
00:01:19.208 --> 00:01:22.757
And all you have to do is just put a
single hash, and then the

25
00:01:22.757 --> 00:01:24.858
rest of the line is commented out,

26
00:01:24.858 --> 00:01:28.550
and won't be interpreted by the Python
interpreter.

27
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.570
You can write anything on here, you

28
00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:37.010
could write print Print Hello World, for
example.

29
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.230
And it won't get run.

30
00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:43.520
Or it will be run, but it won't get
interpreted and it won't get output.

31
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.150
Whereas if the next line I do Print and I
just do Hello.

32
00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.870
And if we run that as well you'll get

33
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.460
just hello, but you won't get that outline
there.

34
00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.150
There, the commented line, there.

35
00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.220
And you can also add comments to the end
of lines.

36
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.400
So, this is an output.

37
00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.160
And, so, you can see, how if we

38
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.040
had something very confusing happening
within the actual script.

39
00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.548
Then you would be able to actually comment
it easily, and have

40
00:02:12.548 --> 00:02:15.920
it so that something which you might not
understand how to do

41
00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.428
in the future, and we will go onto more
complicated code later

42
00:02:19.428 --> 00:02:22.879
on within the course, which this sort of
idea is useful for.

43
00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:27.667
For example, iterations and so on.

44
00:02:27.667 --> 00:02:32.059
What you would find interesting you might
also find it confusing for

45
00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:35.371
example, and so, if you were to comment it
you would be

46
00:02:35.371 --> 00:02:38.827
able to understand it and look over it
later on, read it,

47
00:02:38.827 --> 00:02:42.084
and you'd be able to learn it faster that
way as well.

48
00:02:42.084 --> 00:02:45.033
So there are multiple uses for doing this

49
00:02:45.033 --> 00:02:49.380
sort of practice this sort of practice
whilst coding.

50
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.680
Now, obviously, cuz it's not interpreted,
it is not a requirement of Python.

51
00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.930
However, it is very good coding practice
to have comments within your code, and it

52
00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.400
allows you to make your code more

53
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.900
readable, as I've explained a few minutes
ago.

54
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.410
So, I would recommend that you do comment
your code.

55
00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:16.780
However, within this tutorial this course,
I won't be actually doing much commenting.

56
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.790
And that's simply cuz I'm explaining it
while I'm writing it.

57
00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.920
So, the comments are to explain it, but if

58
00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.350
I'm talking whilst writing, then there's
not much point in

59
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.106
me actually doing any commenting, because
the exact same

60
00:03:28.106 --> 00:03:31.040
content is being said as what I would
write down.

61
00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.980
So thank you for watching, and I hope you
enjoy these videos.

62
00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.417
Just remember that coding practice is not
a

63
00:03:39.417 --> 00:03:42.259
requirement, but it is very, very
beneficial if

64
00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:44.628
you were to take them up quickly, because

65
00:03:44.628 --> 00:03:47.624
it does make your coding life considerably
easier.

66
00:03:47.624 --> 00:03:47.847
