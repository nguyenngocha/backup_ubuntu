2
00:00:04.828 --> 00:00:06.083
Hello and welcome back.

3
00:00:06.083 --> 00:00:09.349
In this video, we'll be in the Ivet Idol
application

4
00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:13.410
or [UNKNOWN] or terminal, depending on
what you want to use.

5
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.240
The reason I'm letting you use the Idol
application

6
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.160
is for some reason it keeps crashing on my
computer.

7
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.340
So I'm just going to do this from the
command line, however it

8
00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.610
works exactly the same way, so it doesn't
matter, which one you use.

9
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.248
The only difference is that with the Idol
application you

10
00:00:30.248 --> 00:00:34.066
don't have to type in python to get your
[INAUDIBLE] up.

11
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:38.040
But that's of no difference really anyway
so.

12
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.955
To start off just go to if you're on a Mac
go down

13
00:00:40.955 --> 00:00:45.250
toUtilities in the applications and open
up terminal, if you're on Windows then

14
00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.850
go to run and then type in Cmd, and you'll
get the command

15
00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.580
line open, and the next thing that you
need to be able to do.

16
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.890
Or the next thing you need to rather is
type

17
00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.100
in python3 and you'll get the Python
interpreter loading gap.

18
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.050
Yeah, it should look something similar to
this and once you

19
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.050
get to three arrows that means you're
ready to start typing.

20
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.770
And in this video we'll be covering the
alphabetic operators.

21
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:17.283
So, there's the obvious ones at first,
we'll just say four plus five and I'll

22
00:01:17.283 --> 00:01:23.600
give you nine and five plus nine is 14,
and so, so it's the plus operator.

23
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.100
And these things before and afterwards are
called the operands.

24
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.290
And there's two operands minimum which are
required for an operator to work.

25
00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.280
The operator is the bit in the middle.

26
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.550
The plus or the minus sign.

27
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.500
The division, multiplication, modulus,
exponential, floor division.

28
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.000
And so on.

29
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.561
Okay, so after we've done the addition is
also obviously minus,

30
00:01:47.561 --> 00:01:52.821
so for minus, five minus three is two five
minus nine, well

31
00:01:52.821 --> 00:01:58.812
eight, is minus three, And then you also
have multiply, multiplication

32
00:01:58.812 --> 00:02:04.510
which is the asterisk symbol, so two times
five, 10 is 20.

33
00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.509
Then you have the division which is the
forward

34
00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.040
slash which is say five divided by three
is 1.67.

35
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.180
Now you can use other functions on these,
so if I wanted to round that then I could

36
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.670
round that to two for example, Now there's
another thing and if

37
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.940
you notice this 5 divide by 3, we have
1.67

38
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.740
roughly, and the way that we can change
that to round down, is

39
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.890
to give us

40
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.225
what we want.

41
00:02:40.225 --> 00:02:43.855
[SOUND] Is 5 slash slash 3.

42
00:02:43.855 --> 00:02:47.856
And that will round it down and get rid of
anything which is a decimal point.

43
00:02:47.856 --> 00:02:52.322
And then this also, the other half of
this, which is 5 multiply 3.

44
00:02:52.322 --> 00:02:59.430
The modular sign is the percentage sign
within this and that gives you 2.

45
00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.930
Now, it may confuse you slightly as to how

46
00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.900
this happens, but that is, is basically
the, the mainder.

47
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.390
So when you divide 5 by 3, you get 1.

48
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.890
And then you have 2 left over from that 3.

49
00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.040
So that's 1 remainder 2, basically.

50
00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.170
Now, you might think that you should get
the decimal point, which is 0.7.

51
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.110
However, if you don't get that.

52
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.410
What you do get, is, you get the remainder
which is 2.

53
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.220
Okay, and the next part is exponential.

54
00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.940
Which if you were to do 5 to the power,
which is done by 2 asterisks.

55
00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.840
So 5 to the power of 2 you get 25.

56
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:39.860
And that

57
00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:51.338
is the main or that is all of the
alphabetic logic operators within python.

58
00:03:51.338 --> 00:03:55.490
So, there will, mainly obvious, the only
two which aren't obvious

59
00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:59.760
are the flaw division, which is two
forward slashes, and the modulus.

60
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.780
And probably the exponential, actually.

61
00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:07.710
So, those last three, they're rarely to be
used, you don't need them as often.

62
00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:09.310
However, its good to be aware that they

63
00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.320
exist, because you will be using them
occasionally.

64
00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:17.282
And, depending on what sort of application
it is you're building, the most common are

65
00:04:17.282 --> 00:04:21.104
those three, probably exponentials, which
you'll be using

66
00:04:21.104 --> 00:04:23.860
later on in one of the lab exercises.

67
00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.932
So thank you for watching and I will see
you in the next video.

68
00:04:26.932 --> 00:04:33.189
