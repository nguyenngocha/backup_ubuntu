00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:05.762
Hello, and welcome back.

3
00:00:05.762 --> 00:00:08.992
In this video, I'll be talking about the
precedence,

4
00:00:08.992 --> 00:00:13.080
or the order of precedence, in which
operators follow.

5
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.820
Now, when you were at school, you might

6
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.740
have heard of something in math class
called BODMAS.

7
00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.010
If you haven't don't worry about it I'll
explain it anyway.

8
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.190
But, the programming language of Python
and most other languages follow the order

9
00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:30.430
of BODMAS, which is spelled B-O-D-M-A-S.

10
00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.130
And what BODMAS tells us is the order from
left to

11
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:40.570
right in which logical operators such as
arithmetic, operators would follow.

12
00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:48.780
The first one B, being the brackets or in
this case, parentheses.

13
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.730
So, if you were to have

14
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.960
something, for example, 15*2+25/4-2.

15
00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.150
Now, what you'd expect the answer there to

16
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.880
come, might not be what you wanted to
happen.

17
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.860
And so, you'd use brackets as the, highest
order of precedence to sort out the

18
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.010
answer, now the answer for this is 34.25
and the reason for that, is

19
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.990
that 15 times by 2 gets evaluated first,
25 divided by 4 gets evaluated

20
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.870
as well then that entire thing is added
together and then 2 is subtracted from it.

21
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.530
And, the reason for that, is that the
brackets are, well, essentially invisible

22
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.930
because the rest of BODMAS states that,

23
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.410
order is next which is, exponential
powers.

24
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.630
But there aren't any of them, so ignores
that.

25
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.610
Go to next two which is division and
multiplication.

26
00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.330
They have the same order of precedence
even though it's goes D then M in the.

27
00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.700
suit, suitor name, it still has the same
order

28
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.950
of precedence it just, sort, sort of can
be

29
00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.720
set but is in that order and so, division

30
00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.790
and multiplication happen at the same time
and so, 15

31
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.330
times by 2 and 25 divided by 4, happen

32
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.490
at the same time and then the last two
letters

33
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.590
which are A and S, stand for addition and

34
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.230
subtraction and they are the next two
things that happen.

35
00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:16.490
And so, you will notice that if we do 15
times by 2, we get 30.

36
00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.470
If we do 25 divided by 4, we have 6.25.

37
00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:28.215
And now, we have we have the minus 2 which
makes that 4.25, and so

38
00:02:28.215 --> 00:02:34.790
what we get there in total is 36.25 minus
2, which is 34.25.

39
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.907
Now, the easier and better way to write
this, would have

40
00:02:40.907 --> 00:02:46.660
been 15 times by 2 plus 25 divided by 4
minus 2.

41
00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.980
That would be the better way to have
written it, and it gets you the

42
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.760
exact same answer, but looking at that,

43
00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.025
you immediately know what's going to
happen when.

44
00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.940
So, that is the order of precedence in
which objects and, automatic

45
00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.930
logic, operators follows within Python and
most of the programming languages.

46
00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.570
So, if you want to remember that, just
remember BODMAS, and it

47
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:17.545
stands for parentheses or brackets, order
or bridges the same as exponential powers.

48
00:03:17.545 --> 00:03:21.760
Then division, multiplication, addition
and subtraction and that is a very useful

49
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.950
thing to remember if you want to remember
the order, and to work out what it

50
00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:34.040
is re, should happen while shown during
calculations and like I said, I can't

51
00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.180
I can't emphasize how much it helps to
have these brackets around each part.

52
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.950
You can have as many brackets as you like
within Python.

53
00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.295
Within these, so you could have 15 times
by 2

54
00:03:47.295 --> 00:03:51.980
plus and then we'll do 25 divided by 4
minus 2.

55
00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.510
That would give you exact same answer and
it might

56
00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.250
make things a bit easier for you to
understand as well,

57
00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.620
with having that bracket, so and make sure
of it, all

58
00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.390
of it happens as first, as the first thing
to happen.

59
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.280
But just make sure that you understand
that

60
00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.380
BODMAS is the order in which it follows.

61
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:17.543
And, when you understand that order, it
will help you diagnose or debug the

62
00:04:17.543 --> 00:04:20.792
problems which you may run into, with,

63
00:04:20.792 --> 00:04:24.128
within future programs where the wrong
answer

64
00:04:24.128 --> 00:04:29.517
is being given and it could be because you
just haven't, given the order of

65
00:04:29.517 --> 00:04:35.363
precedence the correct order, so thank you
for watching and I'll see you soon.
