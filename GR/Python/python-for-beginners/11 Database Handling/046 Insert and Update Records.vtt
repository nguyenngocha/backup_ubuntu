[MUSIC]

2
00:00:05.077 --> 00:00:07.961
So, building on what we saw in the last
video, in which

3
00:00:07.961 --> 00:00:11.183
we create a table, we're going to build
back on that again.

4
00:00:11.183 --> 00:00:13.016
So, if we just create a table again.

5
00:00:13.016 --> 00:00:15.600
So, execute.

6
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.500
And it's going to be create so create
database.

7
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.020
And that is going to be called people.

8
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.560
And then we're going to create a table as
well.

9
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:30.690
[SOUND] And that is going to be called oh,
sorry,

10
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:35.763
no we don't need to create a database.

11
00:00:35.763 --> 00:00:37.685
The database is created for us already.

12
00:00:37.685 --> 00:00:41.374
It's going to be just create table, and
the table's going to be called person.

13
00:00:41.374 --> 00:00:46.372
And then from there, after we create that
table what we need to

14
00:00:46.372 --> 00:00:51.477
do now is, when we run that, we'll receive
that table being made.

15
00:00:51.477 --> 00:00:54.958
[BLANK_AUDIO]

16
00:00:54.958 --> 00:01:00.567
And, of course, I forgot to put in the
column name, so first name, which is text.

17
00:01:00.567 --> 00:01:06.410
Second name, it's going to be a text field
again.

18
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.700
And then the age, which is an integer.

19
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.480
And now we will run that, there we go.

20
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.310
And now what we need to do is we're going
to insert some data

21
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.260
into that, so we're going to do Insert
Into, and it's called Person, and we

22
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.220
going to insert the first name, second
name,

23
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.690
and age, and the values are going to be
Alex

24
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.360
and then Bowers, and then just 17.

25
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.900
And when we run that,

26
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.550
and refresh here.

27
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.330
[SOUND] And if we open up that database
[SOUND]

28
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.895
You will see, that we now have got the.

29
00:01:57.895 --> 00:01:59.574
Oh, sorry, I've got one line.

30
00:01:59.574 --> 00:02:03.711
[BLANK_AUDIO]

31
00:02:03.711 --> 00:02:06.254
Something that we always, always must do,
once we

32
00:02:06.254 --> 00:02:07.786
[BLANK_AUDIO]

33
00:02:07.786 --> 00:02:08.945
Create.

34
00:02:08.945 --> 00:02:15.670
Insert, Update, Delete, or Create, is we
have to commit it, which is what saves it.

35
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.650
And so what we do here,

36
00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.710
is I'm just going to refresh,

37
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.040
and you can see here, now we have Alex
Bowers.

38
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.630
And now you won't actually see the number
inserted here, and the reason for

39
00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.440
that is simply because you're not meant to
actually view the database in this manner.

40
00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.426
And, so, it is still there, is just not
view able to us.

41
00:02:35.426 --> 00:02:40.830
So now that we've committed it, if we kept
doing this again, and again, and again,

42
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:48.216
[BLANK_AUDIO]

43
00:02:48.216 --> 00:02:50.869
And there we go, that's all been run, and

44
00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:53.911
we refresh and then open this page back up
again.

45
00:02:53.911 --> 00:02:57.350
You'll see that we got it save multiple
times.

46
00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.450
So whenever we commit, this is actually
saving the data to the

47
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.920
database, or doing whatever action it is
we're asking it to do.

48
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.580
So if we were to now update where it says

49
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.260
Alex, where Alex, where the last name is
Alex, and

50
00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.660
I was to change the first name to
Alexander for

51
00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:21.750
example, then we'd do db.execute, and it's
going to be Update.

52
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.650
And the table name, which is person, and,
we're

53
00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.930
going to set and then it's the column
name.

54
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.806
So the column name which we are using is,
I'm going to set the first name

55
00:03:34.806 --> 00:03:41.410
equal to Alexander, and then we're going
to do something called a where.

56
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:47.450
Now a where is a way in which, and MySQL,
SQL lite and any of the

57
00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.910
form of database system, will allow you to
choose what data you're selecting based

58
00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:59.280
on a query, and the query in this part is
the where so, was gonna be where

59
00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.830
second name is equal to Bowers.

60
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.270
And now if I was to run this

61
00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.370
and then refresh and view the database
again,

62
00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.260
you will see, and

63
00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:24.870
again I forgot to commit, db.commit.

64
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.300
If we run that now, and refresh, you'll
see that

65
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.739
it is now, okay not too sure what happened
there.

66
00:04:33.739 --> 00:04:43.739
[BLANK_AUDIO]

67
00:04:46.743 --> 00:04:49.463
Sorry about that, the clip sort of crashed
on me, but

68
00:04:49.463 --> 00:04:52.183
as you can see here, although there is
lots of data all

69
00:04:52.183 --> 00:04:55.689
added which you can't actually understand
here, you can see we've

70
00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:59.395
got Alexander added there, and so it has
actually updated the records.

71
00:04:59.395 --> 00:05:01.555
So, like I said, I don't recommend about

72
00:05:01.555 --> 00:05:03.896
you trying view the database and text
format.

73
00:05:03.896 --> 00:05:08.448
Because it's not designed to be visible
that way, but if we look at

74
00:05:08.448 --> 00:05:13.670
it now, you can see that it's 8,192 bytes
which is very, very small.

75
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:17.180
And if you'd save all this data in a way
in which

76
00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:22.190
it's going to be readable properly in
terms of a text file.

77
00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.730
If you were to do Open, Open here as a
text file,

78
00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:27.700
it would probably consider have
considerably

79
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.630
less data, but you would have to

80
00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.970
be through all of the data at once, rather
than finding exactly

81
00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:38.520
what it is by using something like the
wereclaws which we have here.

82
00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.750
So, that is again why a database is going
to be useful.

83
00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.700
We can select data based on a query,
rather

84
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.920
than inspecting all the data and querying
it afterwards.

85
00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.530
So, it's considerably less processing
power needed

86
00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:53.000
and required to run a database than it

87
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.750
is when you're, when you running something

88
00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.830
of, something called a file flat file
system.

89
00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:03.630
Which is when you have a, just a text
file, or a .xml file,

90
00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:08.790
or one of those files which can store
data, and .plist is another example.

91
00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:09.485
So thank you for watching, and-

92
00:06:09.485 --> 00:06:14.679
