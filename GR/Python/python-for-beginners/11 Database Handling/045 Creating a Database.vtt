[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.961 --> 00:00:07.679
Since we have SQLite3 actually provided to
us with

3
00:00:07.679 --> 00:00:10.396
the build of Python which we installed
earlier when

4
00:00:10.396 --> 00:00:13.936
we installed Eclipse and downloaded Python
and everything else,

5
00:00:13.936 --> 00:00:16.940
then we're going to just simply use
SQLite3 for this.

6
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.920
However, you can use stuff like MySQL and
Microsoft Access and so on.

7
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.190
But those require different libraries
which I'm

8
00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.610
not gonna be teaching within this course.

9
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.630
So if you do import SQLite3, then we have
all

10
00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.380
that we need to actually have to work with
the database.

11
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.040
The SQL, SQLite3 which we're importing is
just

12
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.350
a library of files which is provided
within

13
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.780
Python which allows us to interact in the

14
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.610
database by having functions already made
for us.

15
00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.210
And the way which we can see that is if

16
00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.350
we do db is equal to, and we'll do
sqllite3.connect.

17
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.850
And

18
00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.710
now inside here, we put in our name of the
file which were looking to create

19
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.370
the database files, so I'm just gonna call

20
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.588
as database.db now for save this and run
it,.

21
00:01:06.588 --> 00:01:13.068
[SOUND] Sorry about that, I spelt

22
00:01:13.068 --> 00:01:18.589
it wrong, SQL I, there's

23
00:01:18.589 --> 00:01:24.118
not second L within there.

24
00:01:24.118 --> 00:01:27.581
So it's just SQLIite3 and once we run that
and then we've

25
00:01:27.581 --> 00:01:31.830
refreshed over you'll see that we have a,
now an empty database file.

26
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.080
So it we open the ALT we can see it's got
zero bytes within it.

27
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.010
And if we open it there's nothing inside
of the actual database.

28
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.330
So to add stuff to the database.

29
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.850
What we need to do, is first of all, we
need to create a table.

30
00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.320
So we're going to do db.execute and

31
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.700
then within these brackets here we're
putting all

32
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.330
of the SQL code we are looking to execute.

33
00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:04.230
So that can be anything from inserting,
deleting, updating creating, these

34
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.890
all manner of types of SQL commands that
you can put in.

35
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.470
And I'm going to be teaching you the four

36
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.960
basic ones, which is to insert, update,
retrieve, and delete.

37
00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.650
And then also we'll be also using create.

38
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.950
But we'll only use that once.

39
00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.510
And that is initially now.

40
00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:26.700
So what we're going to do is going to
create a table called persons, or person.

41
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.530
And we're going to give that three fields.

42
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.360
So the first field which we're going to do
is called the First Name.

43
00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.910
And that's going to be a text field.

44
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.700
Then we've got a second name, which is

45
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.320
Text Field, and then age, which is an
Integer.

46
00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:47.430
And those have got to have, oops, sorry.

47
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:54.400
And then after that, we need to insert a
couple of pieces of data

48
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.730
into the actual tables, but that is what
we're going to cover in the next video.

49
00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.090
For now when we run this, and open up the

50
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.390
database again, you'll see we now have
bytes within it.

51
00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.160
We've got 80,192 bytes.

52
00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.380
And, if we have an up,

53
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.400
Whoops sorry, we need to refresh, that we
can see

54
00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.630
we got the SQL command is now stored
within here.

55
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.070
So, that is how you create a database, and
how you create a

56
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.410
table within Python, and you're gonna
create as many tables as you want.

57
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.220
And, to show you this, I'll just run it
again.

58
00:03:29.666 --> 00:03:35.990
So, .execute is a is a function that's
built

59
00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:41.760
into the SQLite3 library, which we import,
if we didn't import it, it wouldn't work.

60
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.350
Oh yes you can't also create a table over
something that already exists,

61
00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:57.090
so what we need to do is, if we copy that
command operator at the top,

62
00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.780
we can do drop table, if exists, person.

63
00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.570
Run that again.

64
00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.620
And you'll see that we now don't get an
error.

65
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.260
What's that done is it's deleted that

66
00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.260
initial table cuz [UNKNOWN] existed, is
created it

67
00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.290
again so we won't see any difference but
it's also created the second one now.

68
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.370
So now if we open that up again, and

69
00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.480
refresh, you'll see that we have the first
table there.

70
00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.340
And we also have a second table here.

71
00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.400
So, you can create as many tables within
database

72
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.040
as you like, and you can make them
relational.

73
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.640
So that they relate to each other, so say
the first name here,

74
00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.320
could be related to a second name in a
different table, for example.

75
00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.910
And that way the data stays within sync of
each other.

76
00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.400
So, thank you for watching and in the next

77
00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.960
video I'll show you how to insert and
update records.

78
00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.189
So, I'll see you soon.

79
00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:50.109
