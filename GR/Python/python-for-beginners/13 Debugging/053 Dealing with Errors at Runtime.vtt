1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.999
[SOUND] Now, I'm going to start looking at
[UNKNOWN] and how to debug that.

2
00:00:07.999 --> 00:00:13.318
So, if you open up the debug.py, and then
we can start looking at the code.

3
00:00:13.318 --> 00:00:18.704
So, it's simple enough, it's 1, 2 and 3
and then a fourth option on which the

4
00:00:18.704 --> 00:00:24.400
user puts in a value of their own, and now
we've got a total which is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4.

5
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.620
All the values there upon and then we
print the total out.

6
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:34.080
So, it's very simple and as you can see,
Python has shown us an error here.

7
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.360
Not Python, sorry, Eclipse has shown us
this error.

8
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.080
However, if we run this error, you'll
notice that it

9
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.230
doesn't actually get called upon as being
a syntax error.

10
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.870
This is what we call a runtime error,
because it's not an

11
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.045
actual error with the code as such, it's
nothing wrong with the code.

12
00:00:48.045 --> 00:00:51.590
It is something which only we'll notice
when it's actually

13
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.050
running through the code and therefore
it's an error upon runtime.

14
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.925
And so, if we put any extra value as being

15
00:00:56.925 --> 00:01:00.540
5 press Enter, you'll see we get something
called a traceback.

16
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.290
Now traceback, is where it tells, it gives
us a list

17
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.940
of where all of the occurrences of this
problem might occur.

18
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.790
And because it's only going to occur once
here, it shows us that it's in line 6.

19
00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.040
And so, it shows us also.

20
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.220
That there's a name, a name error and the
name second or

21
00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.930
seocnd, which is what is typed in as that,
is not defined.

22
00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.830
And so, we go back here and change the
lettering around.

23
00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:29.650
And then, run it again.

24
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.660
Again put the value of 5 in there.

25
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.790
You'll see now, there again, something
which is called a type error.

26
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.240
Now, this is a [UNKNOWN] and the reason
for this, is simply

27
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.630
because I typed the 5 in there by accident
a second ago.

28
00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.476
Save that again and run it.

29
00:01:47.476 --> 00:01:53.690
And you'll see, now that we get int of 1,
4 unsupported operand.

30
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.200
Which is, this plus string.

31
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.110
So what we need to do, is put this as a
integer.

32
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.640
And to do that, just put int around the
word and run it again.

33
00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.360
And we get the value of 16 being
outputted.

34
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.220
Which is 4 plus 5 which is 9 plus 2 which
is 11 plus 5 is 16.

35
00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.790
And so, as you can see, it's working
properly now.

36
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.480
The reason why we have to put int around
here

37
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.130
is because we're getting input from the,
from the user.

38
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.210
And it's always going to be interpreted as
a string.

39
00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:29.300
And so, we have to convert it to an

40
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.290
integer otherwise you can't add any number
to a string.

41
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.730
It doesn't work.

42
00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:34.710
So, thank you for watching.

43
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.290
That's how you fix one time errors.

44
00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.446
And I'll see you soon.

45
00:02:39.446 --> 00:02:40.450
