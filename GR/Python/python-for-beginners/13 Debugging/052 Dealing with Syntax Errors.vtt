[MUSIC]

2
00:00:05.196 --> 00:00:10.052
If you look inside of the sources file,
you will see the debug.py file.

3
00:00:10.052 --> 00:00:13.750
Now if you open that, you'll see the code
exactly the same as what I've got here.

4
00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:14.850
And in this video I'm going to be

5
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.170
showing you how you debug syntax errors
within Python.

6
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.590
So if we run the code, you'll see that

7
00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.840
we get this little error here, saying
SyntaxError, invalid syntax.

8
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.260
And then we get this little circumflex or
a caret, pointing towards the equals sign.

9
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.100
Now if we go back into our code.

10
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.910
And if we also, if we look in in here in
more detail.

11
00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.070
It tells us where it's on line two.

12
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.967
So, if we come back to line two, then we
can

13
00:00:37.967 --> 00:00:41.989
see that we've got, if name equal alex,
and that's not,

14
00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:44.966
that is saying, the claim of it to be
equal is

15
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:50.230
not conditional, is not [INAUDIBLE] it has
to be two equal signs.

16
00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.940
And so, that color sign there has actually
pointed us

17
00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.290
to the correct location of the error, and
if we run

18
00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.290
that again, you'll see that we get a
different error,

19
00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.230
but with this one is now linked, no longer
an error.

20
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.980
And now this error here is pointing
towards the final quotes, and

21
00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:11.370
you realize that I didn't actually set the
colon to be set there.

22
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.820
Which is what declares a block for the if
statement.

23
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.955
So if we now put a colon in, and run it
again, [SOUND]

24
00:01:17.955 --> 00:01:22.600
you'll see it's now working, but it's
going down into our other area.

25
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.549
Now this one is an unusual one, because
it's pointing towards

26
00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.360
the t on a print which, there isn't
actually an error here.

27
00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.498
What we are actually looking at is the
line before, or

28
00:01:35.498 --> 00:01:40.470
two lines before, and we got an odd number
of brackets here.

29
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.800
Now we got two opening and then one
closing which leaves 1 and

30
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.680
one more opening, which makes it 2 again
and then minus 1, 2, 1.

31
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.480
We need to add another one to make it back
to 0.

32
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.544
And if we run that.

33
00:01:51.544 --> 00:01:54.608
[BLANK_AUDIO]

34
00:01:54.608 --> 00:01:58.598
Now, we get an unprecedented indent, and
the reason

35
00:01:58.598 --> 00:02:02.511
for that is because it's now indented, too
far in.

36
00:02:02.511 --> 00:02:07.342
And in Python, ind you have to indent to
show a codeblock.

37
00:02:07.342 --> 00:02:10.034
So if something's indented when it
shouldn't be,

38
00:02:10.034 --> 00:02:13.164
or something isn't indented enough, then
it won't work.

39
00:02:13.164 --> 00:02:19.135
So if we undo that indent, [SOUND] then we
get it to finally recognize that

40
00:02:19.135 --> 00:02:24.725
we need to put brackets around here,
because print is a function.

41
00:02:24.725 --> 00:02:27.623
So as you can see, before when it was
pointing at

42
00:02:27.623 --> 00:02:31.820
the t, it actually should have been
pointing at the k here.

43
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.664
And we should have noticed that there
wasn't the correct number of brackets

44
00:02:36.664 --> 00:02:40.372
here, and obviously because Python's an
interpreter,

45
00:02:40.372 --> 00:02:42.426
it's doing its best to tell us.

46
00:02:42.426 --> 00:02:47.760
However, we do need to still look at it
and work out what the actual answer is.

47
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.010
And so if we put the brackets around that,
save it again, and run.

48
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:58.338
[BLANK_AUDIO]

49
00:02:58.338 --> 00:03:01.673
Oh, and I made a mistake there entering
the code, that should have been an i.

50
00:03:01.673 --> 00:03:02.713
Sorry about that.

51
00:03:02.713 --> 00:03:05.668
There we go, and run that again, then we
get 95.

52
00:03:05.668 --> 00:03:08.090
The reason why that error was there
before.

53
00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.540
With the k, is because we were trying to

54
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.120
add on a number which we hadn't actually
set.

55
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.530
So here we were doing k is equal to i
times j,

56
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.970
which is fine, and then the result of
that, plus j plus k.

57
00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.910
Now k doesn't actually have a value, it
hasn't

58
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.960
been set, so you can't put your answer
towards that.

59
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.125
And that is why [SOUND], I've just changed
that

60
00:03:28.125 --> 00:03:30.246
to i because it should have been i
initially.

61
00:03:30.246 --> 00:03:33.660
In your file it will now be i, so don't
worry about that.

62
00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.240
Okay, so now you can see that the final
answer now is 95.

63
00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.300
Which if we did that on the calculator,
would be correct.

64
00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.411
And, that is how you debug syntax errors
within Python.

65
00:03:44.411 --> 00:03:44.617
