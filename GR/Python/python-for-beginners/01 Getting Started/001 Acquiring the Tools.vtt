2
00:00:05.802 --> 00:00:09.832
Hello, I'm Max [UNKNOWN] program.tv, and
in this video, I'll be showing you

3
00:00:09.832 --> 00:00:14.000
how to set up Eclipse with Python, and how
to setup you're working environment.

4
00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.280
So the first thing that we need to do is
actually grab Python.

5
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.140
I'm going to be setting this up for a Mac.

6
00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.220
However, the setup for Windows is quite
similar.

7
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.290
So you should be okay following these,
this video for

8
00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.550
setting it up for Windows and for Linux as
well.

9
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.060
Okay, so first thing we need to do, is get
to python.org slash download.

10
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.670
And you'll see a page similar to this,

11
00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.130
one saying alternative implementations and
one saying download Python.

12
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.010
We want to visit the download Python
section.

13
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.030
And when we're there, you'll see the first
line

14
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.210
says that there's two versions, Python 2.7
and Python 3.2.

15
00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.120
You'll also notice on the left-hand side
there's

16
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.615
a beta schedule and beta 3.3 is arriving
soon.

17
00:00:57.615 --> 00:01:02.560
If this, if beta 3.3 is available while

18
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.920
you're watching this video, don't bother
getting it.

19
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.420
It is not going to be the same as Python
3.2, and so some of the things are

20
00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.220
going to be different which I teach you
might

21
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.010
not be written in the same way in Python
3.3.

22
00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.140
So if we stick with Python 3.2, which is
better

23
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.420
than Python 2.7 cuz it's newer and more
secure and

24
00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.500
also faster for processing then we'll all
be on the

25
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.090
same page and you'll be able to follow
along properly.

26
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.530
so if you scroll down to development areas
3.2

27
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.300
and you'll see there's a list of different
installation packages.

28
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.460
And the first two of Windows, and the top
one

29
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.255
if you're on Windows is the one you'll
want to get.

30
00:01:40.255 --> 00:01:42.560
That the one that doesn't include the
source code so it's a

31
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.780
smaller download and it's a binary file
which means it's an executable.

32
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.780
You can just run it and it will install
it.

33
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.770
And then the second one is the one which
you ignore.

34
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:59.660
Now if you go down again you'll see the
Mac OS X1s and the top

35
00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.640
one is 32 and 64 bit and that is for 10.6
and 10.7, which is Snow Leopard and Lion.

36
00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.250
I'm using lighting, so I'm going to have
to

37
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.880
be downloading the top bunk, however if
you're using

38
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.131
the, if you're using the, anything between
10.3 and

39
00:02:12.131 --> 00:02:15.800
10.6, then you can get either of the two.

40
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.140
[INAUDIBLE] 10.6 can get you either of the
two, but

41
00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.100
10.3 to 10.5 will have to get the bottom
one.

42
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.380
I would recommend if you're not on 2.6 or
2.7 to upgrade if you can

43
00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:32.050
because it's going to make your life a lot
easier because 32 bit is obviously slower.

44
00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:38.050
However, if you're processor doesn't allow
64 bit then it's up to you.

45
00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.270
And then if you go down to the bottom two,
these are this

46
00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.320
ones for Linux and Unix, and you can you
use these on Mac OSX.

47
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.590
However since this an installer, you may
as well just use the installer.

48
00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.460
Using these two, if you are using Linux, I
assume that you know how to use the

49
00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.930
command line or the terminal, and you will
have

50
00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.240
you be using the terminal to actually
install these.

51
00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.650
There will be packages for most Linux
versions.

52
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.230
So you should be okay if you need to
download a package.

53
00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.390
It should be ready and you can use apt-get
up and install.

54
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:11.990
So you should be okay.

55
00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.880
But I'm going to be downloading the 3.2.3.

56
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.030
And if we click on, OK and it'll start
downloading.

57
00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.568
In the meantime, I'll be going over to
Eclipse.

58
00:03:22.568 --> 00:03:27.480
Eclipse.org slash downloads, is the file,
is the webpage you want to be visiting.

59
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.840
And you'll see there's Eclipse classic.

60
00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.480
Now this is the version of Eclipse that we

61
00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.640
want, because Eclipse is primarily used
for Java development.

62
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.730
And so, you get a lot of variations which

63
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.720
are for different types of developers, and
so on.

64
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.290
But with Eclipse Classic, it's the most
basic

65
00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.450
one and it's the best one, because we're
going

66
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.990
to be adding a add on, which will

67
00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:58.150
allow us to use the Python interpreter
within Eclipse.

68
00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.760
The reason why we're going to get Eclipse
is because it is a, it's a good IDA.

69
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.600
It's well supported.

70
00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.650
And also, it's universal.

71
00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.390
You can use it on any platform.

72
00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.930
If we go back to the page you'll notice
that this

73
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.050
three on the drop down list is three
different operation systems.

74
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:19.140
Your one should be chosen by default
anyway,

75
00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.660
but if it's not click on there and you'll

76
00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.820
be able to go across to development one

77
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.230
and we'll get you downloading the 64 bit
version.

78
00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.620
Okay and once we've got to that you'll see
a link in the middle, it'll be a mirror so

79
00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.890
it won't care what country it says it
should be

80
00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:43.200
a country that is fairly close to where
you are.

81
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.770
And that's all we need to do for that.

82
00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.260
And for Python all you need to do is click
on Ent and run it.

83
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.310
It'll extract all of the information from
the DMG

84
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:59.000
file and then that's everything we need
from Python dock.

85
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.720
And we're going to go and go into our
applications.

86
00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.795
And if we scroll down, you'll see that we
have Python

87
00:05:07.795 --> 00:05:12.170
3.2, and from there, inside there, you'll
see just four files.

88
00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:17.820
And this Python documentation and launcher
and update shell.

89
00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.090
And, and a file called idle.

90
00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:24.120
Now the idle application is one that we're
going to be using and wanting to keep.

91
00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.380
So we're going to drag that down to the
dock,

92
00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.070
just to make it easy to find in the
future.

93
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:30.340
And we can minimize that again.

94
00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:35.420
And, once this is, this is finished
downloading the

95
00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:39.870
173 megabyte, megabytes that there is,
we're going to

96
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.440
have to put that on the dock as well

97
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.780
because Eclipse doesn't actually install,
it's just a shortcut.

98
00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.340
So, to make it easy to find again, if we
have it on

99
00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.510
the dock, then you don't have to go
through all your downloads area again.

100
00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:55.540
Okay, so now that the eclipse file has
finished downloading, what

101
00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.740
we can do is we can just go and run this.

102
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:04.470
By over, well extract it, which will punch
it all inside a folder somewhere.

103
00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:07.720
And once that folder's extracted, then
what we need to do

104
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:16.580
is, drag it down to the dock and we can
then run our last setup

105
00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:21.806
on the Workspace.

106
00:06:21.806 --> 00:06:28.089
[SOUND] Kay, so if you open up your finder
and you'll

107
00:06:28.089 --> 00:06:34.654
find the Eclipse, in, icon looks like this
sort of moon.

108
00:06:34.654 --> 00:06:37.504
And what we're going do is we're going to
drag that icon down to the dock

109
00:06:37.504 --> 00:06:41.360
to make it easier to find again in the
future, we can close that window down.

110
00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.570
And if we opened up Eclipse, you'll get

111
00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:45.760
this little warning that it's downloaded
from the Internet.

112
00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:46.500
Click on Open.

113
00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:49.920
And you'll see here we get Eclipse Indigo.

114
00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:55.270
Now Eclipse Indigo is just the version
name, so 3.7 is called Indigo.

115
00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:57.420
Also it means that if yours is slightly
different, don't

116
00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:01.820
worry about it, it just means you got a
later version.

117
00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.275
So from that, click on OK.

118
00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:07.330
And the first thing that we need to do
after its finished

119
00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:12.890
loading up this Workspace, is go to Help
and Install New Software.

120
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.250
Now where it says Install New Software we
need to do, type in our web address

121
00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:22.693
and this is gonna be pydev.org slash

122
00:07:22.693 --> 00:07:28.320
updates, and click on Add and it will
start searching.

123
00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:32.900
And it'll find the PYDev, and it'll find
another one called PYDev Mylyn.

124
00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:38.410
Now the Mylyn one, you don't want do get
because you don't need it.

125
00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:42.439
So, just download the PYDev normal one and
click on Next.

126
00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:09.850
Then after this we'll be setting up the
rest of the Workspace.

127
00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:14.590
You'll get a little popup which says do
you trust

128
00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:20.610
these certificates, and that's where
Aptana, Pydev, and Pydev Aptana.

129
00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:23.860
And all you have to do is just check,
click it and then click on OK.

130
00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:26.420
And it will continue and once the install
is

131
00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:29.470
finished it will ask you to Restart and
Eclipse.

132
00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:31.350
Just click on OK or Restart Now.

133
00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:36.990
And, it'll load it up all again.

134
00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:38.250
And then from there what we're going to do

135
00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:41.120
is we have to go into the preferences for
Eclipse.

136
00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.940
For this Workspace Launcher you can click
on this

137
00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:48.880
little checkbox here which will set it as
default.

138
00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.820
And, we're gonna ask you when ever you
want

139
00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:53.060
to launch again, so you won't see this
page again.

140
00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:54.920
And, click on OK.

141
00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:00.620
And, now we got this loaded up, and if we
go into

142
00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:06.970
our preferences you'll see that we have a,
a type called PYDev.

143
00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:11.190
If you click on there, click on the
extension in front of it.

144
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:12.740
You go down to Interpretive Python.

145
00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:20.030
From that you can see, I've got mine
already set up, which is Py, Python 3.2.

146
00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:23.060
However, to do this I'll just move it and
to create

147
00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:28.855
a new one, you need to go to Browse >
Applications.

148
00:09:28.855 --> 00:09:36.988
[SOUND] Actually, now, you'll need to go
into, into your devices, your hard drive.

149
00:09:36.988 --> 00:09:42.460
Go to User and then scroll down and find
Local.

150
00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:44.420
From lLcal, you need to go into BEN.

151
00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:47.367
And then, from BEN, you'll need to go into
Python 3.2.

152
00:09:47.367 --> 00:09:49.760
Make sure it's Python 3.2.

153
00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:56.720
And there are other ones here, which have
like [UNKNOWN] and, and so on.

154
00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.520
So make sure that you choose the correct
one, python 3.2.

155
00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:03.700
If your version is later, it will be
python 3.3 for example.

156
00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:08.780
But, make sure go with Python 3.2 and
click on Open.

157
00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:18.420
And if you just rename the top to Python
3.2, and click on OK.

158
00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:23.490
You'll find all these libraries.

159
00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:24.490
Just click on OK.

160
00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:29.280
And that is exactly how I had it set up a
second ago.

161
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.150
And then from there, you'll also want to
go into General.

162
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:32.870
Expand that.

163
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:36.430
Go down to Editors, and go into Text
Editors.

164
00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:38.030
From there you'll see a check box, yours

165
00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:40.590
won't be checked, and it's called show
line numbers.

166
00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:42.390
You want to make sure that is checked.

167
00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:46.060
It'll make it much easier for us to
compare codes

168
00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:49.240
should you run into any problems later on
in the course.

169
00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:52.990
And if you do run into any problems then
you can look

170
00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:56.450
and see what your line looks like compared
to what mine looks like.

171
00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:00.030
Because the compiler will give you errors
depending on

172
00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:02.110
which line the errors are on, and so on.

173
00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:05.010
But we will go into that in a bit more
detail later on.

174
00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:10.870
So from that just click on OK and if we go
over to File.

175
00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:14.120
You'll want to go into New and Quit, click
on Project.

176
00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:18.530
Once you've gone to project you'll see a
drop down list which looks like this.

177
00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:19.740
And at the bottom there will be a PYDev.

178
00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:24.650
You'll want to click on expand it and
click on PYDev project.

179
00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:29.100
If you click on Next, you'll see that you
get this little Create Project.

180
00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:34.500
And I'm just gonna call this Python and
I've learned to program.

181
00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:38.200
And from there, you can call this whatever
you want by the way.

182
00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.540
It makes no difference what you call it.

183
00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:42.740
And then where it says grammar version you
want to change

184
00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:47.740
that to 3.0, and the interpreter change
from default to Python 3.2.

185
00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:52.280
From that click on Next, and then click on
Finish.

186
00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:58.690
And you'll see at the top right of the
page we have py, PyDev and

187
00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:02.870
Java, you can right click on Java and
click on Close, I'll just remove that.

188
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:05.420
So you'd have that in the way.

189
00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:08.280
What you'll want to do in the top
right-hand corner is click on this little

190
00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:12.900
table sort of button, and click down on
other.

191
00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:16.640
And then go to pipe, PYDev, and click on
OK.

192
00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:22.520
What this'll do, is it, it'll set up
another of these PyDevs.

193
00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:24.780
And it should give you a look which

194
00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:27.770
has this package explorer on the left hand
side.

195
00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:32.860
If not, then go to Window, and in your

196
00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:36.700
show view you will be able to find Package
Explorer.

197
00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:39.510
And if you click on that it'll open up as
well.

198
00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:43.080
And that's all that you need open, if you
look on the left

199
00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:47.390
hand side here you'll see that we have a
folder called Learn Python.

200
00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:50.570
To create one of those you just go on New

201
00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:54.260
and then click on Folder and then type in
Learn Python.

202
00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:58.690
And that is all that you need to continue
with these videos.

203
00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:02.703
So, thank you for watching and I will see
you soon.

204
00:13:02.703 --> 00:13:07.689
