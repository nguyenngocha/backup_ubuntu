00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:02.050
In

2
00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.280
this video I'll be showing you how to
check whether

3
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:12.930
Python is working properly in your, within
your Eclipse workspace.

4
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.020
So you should have a setup, similar to
this where you

5
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.990
have on the left, on the side, the learn
Python folder.

6
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.290
If not then just try click, go into new.

7
00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:22.150
And create a folder.

8
00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.180
And inside that folder, we're gonna create
a new file.

9
00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.871
That file, we're going to call just
hello.pui.

10
00:00:30.871 --> 00:00:33.030
.pui is the extension for Python.

11
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.270
And if you click on Finish then it'll run
and create that.

12
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.290
And you'll also need to allow it to have

13
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.410
incoming connections and not too sure what
to use

14
00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.860
this connection for, but best used for
some vids,

15
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.240
so just click on allow, and it will be
fine.

16
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.630
And, there's two ways that which we need
to do this.

17
00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.584
The first way is because we're using an
IDA,

18
00:00:58.584 --> 00:01:02.910
It's going to be a simple [INAUDIBLE]
print function.

19
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.990
And I'll cover what this means later on in
the cast, this

20
00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:08.600
is just to check whether or not what we've
got setup works.

21
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.280
And the way that we do that is we just do
print, and then

22
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.430
inside the two brackets, well, I'll be

23
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.260
calling them paren, parenthesis from now
on.

24
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.010
And inside the parentheses we have two
double quotes to start and end the string.

25
00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.110
And I'll call out what the string is later
on as well.

26
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.340
And then inside there we just type the
text Hello World.

27
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.430
And then we end the line with a semicolon.

28
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.570
That's all we need.

29
00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.550
If save.

30
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.610
And go up to this button here, which looks
like the play button.

31
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.040
It says run as.

32
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.210
If you click that, you'll get this little
pop up.

33
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.150
This pop up will appear just once.

34
00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.900
If you need to go to Python run click on
OK.

35
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.190
And at the bottom here, in the console,

36
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.230
you'll get the output, which is Hello
World.

37
00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.290
Now, if you don't get this you'll most
likely receive an error.

38
00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.360
And all you need to do is check that you
spelled the function right.

39
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.870
And that you have the quotes in there.

40
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.260
If you don't have the quotes in there, it
won't work.

41
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.868
And if you don't have the the

42
00:02:04.868 --> 00:02:07.640
function spelled right, then it won't
output either.

43
00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.380
Okay.

44
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.305
The second way which we can do this, is if
we were doing it

45
00:02:12.305 --> 00:02:14.174
with command line and you would need

46
00:02:14.174 --> 00:02:16.559
something called [UNKNOWN] bang or hash
bang.

47
00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:23.020
And the way you do that is use a hash and,
well a bang or an exclamation point.

48
00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:29.328
Now that's quite hard to read, so and they
hash is the, sort

49
00:02:29.328 --> 00:02:35.425
of it looks not a crosses of grid and then
an exclamation point.

50
00:02:35.425 --> 00:02:42.200
And then what you need to to is slash USR
slash local slash bean slash hyphen.

51
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:49.685
That's all I need to do and that, slash
python and just make sure

52
00:02:49.685 --> 00:02:57.330
that is the link towards your where the
actual file is saved.

53
00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.120
The interpreters saved and the reason for
that

54
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.100
is so that when you run this page, when

55
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.500
you run the script it will find the

56
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.900
interpreter and then be able to run it
properly.

57
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:08.340
However.

58
00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.290
We won't be using the hash bang or the
[UNKNOWN] bang in

59
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.880
our videos and, and our lesson, because we
are using an IDE.

60
00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.740
Okay so, that's all there is to this, if
you don't get the output.

61
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.290
And, it doesn't give you an error, then
follow the previous

62
00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.490
video, in the setup again, cuz you
would've missed out on

63
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:31.470
the stages, like bite of link 2, a python
interpreted wrong

64
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.600
or you might have set up your work space
slightly wrong.

65
00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.900
So, just follow the previous video until
you get the right output here.

66
00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.360
And the output is in the console at the
bottom saying Hello World.

67
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.979
So thank you for watching, and I'll see
you soon.

68
00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:47.108
