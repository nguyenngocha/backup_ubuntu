2
00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.521
Now with inputs in Python, this is where
one of

3
00:00:07.521 --> 00:00:11.650
the major changes has happened, between
Python 2.7 and Python 3.

4
00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.680
So if you're using anything lower than
Python 3.0, then you'll

5
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.120
need to, first listen to the first half of
this video.

6
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.060
And if you load using Python 3 and
onwards, you

7
00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.620
need to listen to the second half of this
video.

8
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.620
So the first half is, that if you

9
00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:31.360
are using Python 2.7 or any version below
Python

10
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:37.060
3, then you need to use an, a, a function
called raw input to get the input.

11
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.690
And this takes one prompter which is the
prompt.

12
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.860
Now the prompt is whatever you have out,
want to have outputted towards the user.

13
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:51.580
Now, the problem with raw input is that
it's no longer a function within Python 3.

14
00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.900
And so you, if you were to change your

15
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.940
code toward Python 3, it would no longer
work.

16
00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.190
Now, there is a function called Input.

17
00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.947
However this allows the code which
somebody

18
00:01:01.947 --> 00:01:07.750
actually writes, to be able to be
executed.

19
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:13.658
If it were to insert a said data, a
certain type of code which is

20
00:01:13.658 --> 00:01:17.520
Python, which Python, which can be read by
Python, it will get run by Python.

21
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.639
Which is obviously a quite large security
flaw.

22
00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:24.126
And the only way you, you can get around
that, is to use the raw input.

23
00:01:24.126 --> 00:01:26.901
Now, if you're are using Python 3, you

24
00:01:26.901 --> 00:01:29.994
have the actual function of input, however
it

25
00:01:29.994 --> 00:01:33.958
no longer uses the evaluation function
which will

26
00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:37.470
utterly run whatever code they put into
it.

27
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.230
If you want that functionality to be

28
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.137
available, you have to put eval around
Python.

29
00:01:42.137 --> 00:01:45.365
Around the input function, and that will
run whatever code they put into it.

30
00:01:45.365 --> 00:01:48.930
However, most of the time, you aren't
looking to do anything like that.

31
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.831
So, if you are using Python 3, you can
simply use the

32
00:01:52.831 --> 00:01:57.620
input function, which is what you should
be able to do, just do.

33
00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.760
If you are using Python 2.7, I would
recommend that

34
00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.230
you upgrade to Python 3 cuz it is much
more secure.

35
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.980
So, now, if we're going to create a print
function.

36
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.530
All we need to do is just output two
lines, and then we'll do a prompt.

37
00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.320
And this is just to get somebody to press
cont press any key to continue.

38
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.072
So the first output will be something
like.

39
00:02:19.072 --> 00:02:23.466
[SOUND] something like, hello Alex, and
then I'll

40
00:02:23.466 --> 00:02:26.949
just do a, a final one saying thank you.

41
00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:30.200
Now, in the between here, we're going to
do an input.

42
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.350
Now with the input, it takes one parameter
which is the prompt.

43
00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.635
So the prompt I'm going to do is press any
key to continue.

44
00:02:36.635 --> 00:02:39.675
[SOUND] And now if we run this, you'll see

45
00:02:39.675 --> 00:02:43.261
at the bottom where you get the first two
lines.

46
00:02:43.261 --> 00:02:46.526
However, the third line isn't showing,
because the prompt

47
00:02:46.526 --> 00:02:49.720
has not been, because the input hasn't
been given.

48
00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.860
Now, press any key to continue.

49
00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.260
If I press Enter, you see that we now get
the thank you, which is

50
00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:01.170
what you'd expect to happen, which is how
it press any key to continue, works.

51
00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.966
Is, it takes whatever value you press, and
it just runs it to the next one.

52
00:03:04.966 --> 00:03:06.750
Runs you to the next line.

53
00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.460
Now, this is something which you will use
quite often within Python.

54
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:13.660
As well as what we're going to cover in

55
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.650
the next video, which is receiving a data
input.

56
00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.973
So I'll see you in the next video, and
thank you for watching.

57
00:03:19.973 --> 00:03:24.759
