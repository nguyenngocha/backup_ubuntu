1
00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:04.840
For this first exercise of the chapter,
we're gonna write two functions.

2
00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.910
One that computes the tax based on a gross
amount.

3
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.650
And the second function will calculate a
net

4
00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.340
pay using the tax function we write
previously.

5
00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:17.150
So, let's get started.

6
00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.770
We're gonna call this program
chap11ex1.py.

7
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.920
So, the first thing we're going to do is
write our tax function.

8
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.186
And in comments, I'm going to show you the
tax table.

9
00:00:29.186 --> 00:00:35.320
$0 through $240, the percentage tax is 0%.

10
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:42.116
$241 through $480, the tax rate is 15%.

11
00:00:42.116 --> 00:00:47.720
And then $481 and greater, the tax rate is
28%.

12
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.870
So, using that table, we can write the
following function.

13
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.190
We're gonna call our function tax.

14
00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.640
Our parameter will be amount.

15
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.850
And then we just write an if elif
statement.

16
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.800
If amount is less than or equal to $240.

17
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.750
Return 0, elif amount greater than 240 and

18
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.490
amount less than or equal to $480,

19
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.714
return amount times 0.15 for the 15%.

20
00:01:19.714 --> 00:01:25.860
Else return amount times 0.28 for the
taxed amount.

21
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.830
So, let's write a quick program just to
test the function.

22
00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:38.997
We'll say print enter amount, amount
equals int input.

23
00:01:38.997 --> 00:01:46.305
And then we'll say print, The tax is, plus
string tax amount and we will do

24
00:01:46.305 --> 00:01:53.604
it on a couple of even numbers so you can
get an idea how the function works.

25
00:01:53.604 --> 00:02:02.915
So, chap11ex1.py, so we have an error,
very good, let's take a look, line 15.

26
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.760
Usually, when an error like this occurs,
it's usually

27
00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.500
because you didn't close all your
parenthesis, just like that.

28
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.440
And again, I leave these errors in because
you're

29
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.430
going to be making the same types of
mistakes.

30
00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.080
So, it helps to be able to see how I fix
them to aid you in your debugging efforts.

31
00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:23.310
Let's run it again.

32
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.790
There it is.

33
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.000
So, let's say the amount is 100 and the
tax is 0.

34
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.280
Run it again.

35
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.950
And say, the amount is 300 and the tax is
45.

36
00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.308
That's 15%.

37
00:02:37.308 --> 00:02:38.670
That's right.

38
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.890
Let's run it one more time.

39
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.036
1,000 and the tax is $280.

40
00:02:44.036 --> 00:02:45.300
That's 28%.

41
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.770
So, that's right.

42
00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.320
So, let's go back to our program.

43
00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.700
Now we're ready to add the net pay
function.

44
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.820
So, for net pay, our parameter will be the
gross pay and we'll simply return the

45
00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:04.950
gross pay minus the amount they were taxed
on the gross pay.

46
00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.820
We're not taking into consideration any
other sort of deductions or anything.

47
00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.630
Net is based strictly on how much you're
taxed.

48
00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:13.870
Let's write a new program.

49
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:14.720
I'll leave this one in.

50
00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.300
And we'll say print enter gross pay.

51
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:25.430
We'll call it gp is equal int input.

52
00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:31.082
Then we'll say, print Net pay is, plus net

53
00:03:31.082 --> 00:03:32.610
pay, and we're gonna have to make that a
string.

54
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:33.110
That

55
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.930
time, we have the right number of
parentheses.

56
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.310
So, let's Exit and Save.

57
00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.810
Let's

58
00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.590
clear the screen.

59
00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.712
So, let's say it's $1,000, and the net pay
is 720 and that's

60
00:03:50.712 --> 00:03:56.280
right because it would've been $280 minus
1,000 to get 720.

61
00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.130
Let's run it one more time, let's take
500, and that's correct.

62
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.180
Again, because of the 28%, that would be
140.

63
00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.686
Let's look at the program one more time.

64
00:04:06.686 --> 00:04:12.300
So, our tax function uses an if elif to
determine and return

65
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:18.080
the tax on a given amount, and our net pay
function uses

66
00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:23.800
the tax function to determine net pay
based on a user's gross pay.

67
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.030
So, that wraps up this first exercise of
the chapter and now we're ready to

68
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.180
move to the second exercise where we're
going

69
00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.400
to revisit computing the factorial of a
number.
