1
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.200
For this second exercise of the chapter

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.590
we're going to add some functionality to
the

3
00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.500
student class, that we didn't include when
we

4
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.420
had implemented the class back in the
lessons.

5
00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.780
So I pulled up the file that had the
student class definition.

6
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.703
The first thing let's do is let's save it
as a new file.

7
00:00:17.703 --> 00:00:18.203
[BLANK_AUDIO]

8
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:21.180
Go to computer.

9
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:21.680
[BLANK_AUDIO].

10
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.200
We're in Python 30.

11
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.630
There we go.

12
00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.290
And we're gonna call it student1.py.

13
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:34.854
Change this to All Files like so.

14
00:00:34.854 --> 00:00:35.470
[BLANK_AUDIO].

15
00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.310
The first bit of functionality we want to
add is a two string method.

16
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.280
So we write, def, two underscores, S-T-R,

17
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.996
two more underscores, and self, as the
parameter.

18
00:00:50.996 --> 00:00:53.230
And then what wanna do is we're going to
put

19
00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.390
some field headings, for lack of a better
term, here.

20
00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.410
So we're going to say return, name, plus
self name.

21
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:08.730
Plus a new line and then we wanna continue
this string on the next line.

22
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.330
So we'll put a backslash right here.

23
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.520
Let's scoot over to here, then we'll have

24
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.640
the student's ID displayed next, plus a
new line.

25
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.130
And we wanna go down to the next line.

26
00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.088
Now we wanna add the students grades.

27
00:01:24.088 --> 00:01:26.630
So here we're gonna call the show grades

28
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.030
method inside two string, which works just
fine,

29
00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.380
and that will display the students grades,
out

30
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.150
beside the heading Grades, as we have
right here.

31
00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.739
So, let's test that.

32
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.874
We'll stick with what we have here, and
let's change

33
00:01:45.874 --> 00:01:50.997
this line to print stu1, so we'll save the
file, type

34
00:01:50.997 --> 00:01:56.774
student1.py and so there's the name Jones,
there's the ID

35
00:01:56.774 --> 00:02:02.440
123, and there are the grades, 88, 84, and
91.

36
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.910
So let's go back to the file and now let's
add

37
00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.770
one more method and let's compute the
average of the students grades.

38
00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.960
So here we're going to create a total
variable, set it to 0.

39
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.860
Then we're going to loop through the
grades,

40
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.100
taking each grade and adding it to the
total.

41
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.660
And then to return the average, we're
going to return the total, divided by the

42
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.560
length of grades which will be the number
of grades in the list.

43
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.190
[BLANK_AUDIO].

44
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:48.578
So let's do a print average, and then
string, stu1, average, just like so,

45
00:02:48.578 --> 00:02:51.640
[BLANK_AUDIO]

46
00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.400
Save the file.

47
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.560
[BLANK_AUDIO]

48
00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.880
Run the program again.

49
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.760
We have some illegal syntax.

50
00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.820
I'm sure I know what the problem is, I
left off the closing parenthesis.

51
00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:08.630
So let's save.

52
00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.850
Okay, we're gonna stick with this problem,
and I see what I did wrong.

53
00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.380
Just trying to work through here very
quickly.

54
00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.900
I forgot to reference the class using
self.

55
00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.570
And that's a common mistake that you're
going to make.

56
00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.560
I shouldn't have made it, since I did
reference

57
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.970
it correctly there, but we get patterns in
our head.

58
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.720
And I'm so used to working with data
structures outside

59
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.772
of the class, that I'll sometimes forget
to put the self.

60
00:03:41.772 --> 00:03:43.040
before that.

61
00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.350
So let's try it again.

62
00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.770
Now let's clear the screen.

63
00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:52.000
And type student1.py, and that time it
worked just fine.

64
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.090
So again to summarize what we did for this
exercise, is we added 2 methods.

65
00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.360
First we added a 2 string method, that
displays the name, the ID, and

66
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.840
the grades with helpful headings to let
the user know what they're looking at.

67
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.830
Certainly didnt have to use those, but it
comes in handy

68
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.780
to display the information in a way that
you can understand.

69
00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.290
And then we created an average method that
takes all

70
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.730
the grades in the student object, and
returns the total.

71
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.190
And with that we're finished with this

72
00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.450
introductory chapter on Object Oriented
Programming and

73
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.470
we're ready to move to the next chapter
where we're going to discuss inheritance.
