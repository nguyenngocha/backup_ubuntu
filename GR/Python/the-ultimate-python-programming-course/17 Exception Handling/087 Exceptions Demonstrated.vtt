00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:02.780
In this chapter, we're going to learn how

2
00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:07.020
to handle errors that occur in Python
programs.

3
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.250
These errors are also called exceptions.

4
00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.800
In fact, that's the more correct name.

5
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.720
Exceptions occur when something in a
program goes wrong.

6
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.130
The two examples I'm going to show in this
lesson

7
00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.140
are when you try to divide a number by
zero.

8
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.630
And when you try to open a file that
doesn't exist.

9
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.828
But there are many other exceptions.

10
00:00:25.828 --> 00:00:31.090
But we wanna distinguish exceptions from
other types of errors such as when your

11
00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.210
entering your code and you type the name
of a function such as Print incorrectly.

12
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.830
That's not really an exception, that's
just a typographical error.

13
00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.770
The types of exceptions that we want to
discuss in

14
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.120
this chapter occur when the program's
running, or at run time.

15
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.500
So, let's look at a couple of examples for
this first lesson.

16
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.755
We're gonna create a program called
accept.py.

17
00:00:55.755 --> 00:00:59.512
So the first thing I wanna do is
demonstrate the divide by zero exception.

18
00:00:59.512 --> 00:01:03.840
So let's prompt the user to enter a couple
of numbers.

19
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.960
Then we might say, quotient is

20
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.650
equal to numerator, numerator divided by
denominator.

21
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.487
And we can print the quotient.

22
00:01:16.487 --> 00:01:21.310
So, let's save the program.

23
00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.307
We'll run it.

24
00:01:23.307 --> 00:01:26.645
So, we'll do 12 and 2.

25
00:01:26.645 --> 00:01:28.231
And that's six.

26
00:01:28.231 --> 00:01:30.182
Let's run it again.

27
00:01:30.182 --> 00:01:33.125
This time we'll enter 12 and 0.

28
00:01:33.125 --> 00:01:38.155
And here we get an exception,
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero.

29
00:01:38.155 --> 00:01:41.410
So, this exception was thrown by the

30
00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.770
program when we entered zero for a
denominator.

31
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.410
What we're going to learn in this chapter
is how

32
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.700
to recognize this error and keep the
program from crashing.

33
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.610
Cuz that's the last thing you want your
programs

34
00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.500
to do when someone else is using them is

35
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.730
to have it crash and take you back all

36
00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.610
the way out of the program to the
operating system.

37
00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:05.940
Alright, let's look at one more example.

38
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.650
Comment out this code.

39
00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:12.380
And we'll do a very simple one.

40
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.640
It's a one liner.

41
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.920
We'll try to open a file that doesn't
exist or open it to read.

42
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.130
We'll save.

43
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.030
Come back to the operating system.

44
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.530
And

45
00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.714
here we get an IO error, No such file or
directory: 'blah.txt'.

46
00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.200
So that's another example of an exception
that can be

47
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.500
handled inside the program so that the
program doesn't crash.

48
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.250
So with that, we're ready to move to the
next lesson where we're going to

49
00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.500
look at the first way to handle exceptions

50
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.160
and that's using something called a
tri-accept statement.
