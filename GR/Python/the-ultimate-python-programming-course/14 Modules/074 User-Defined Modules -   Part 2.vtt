00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:03.720
In the last lesson, we saw how to import

2
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.070
all of the functions from a module into a
program.

3
00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:12.190
In this lesson, we're going to learn how
to, only import the particular

4
00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:17.510
functions that we want from a module into
a program without bringing everything in.

5
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.620
So first, I'll look at the, module that

6
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.370
we're working with just to refresh your
memory.

7
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:27.150
And you'll see we have, 3 functions,
average, square, and square root.

8
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.580
So this time we're going to build a
program, that first only brings

9
00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.990
in the average function, then we'll

10
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:37.320
demonstrate how to import average, and
square.

11
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.030
But with out importing the, square root
function.

12
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.425
So we're going to start a new program,
we're going to call it.

13
00:00:42.425 --> 00:00:46.030
Newtontest2.py.

14
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.810
And so, were going to say, from newton,
import, average.

15
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.260
Before, to import everything, we wrote
import star or asterisk.

16
00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.790
But all we wanna do is import the average
function this

17
00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.280
time, so well import the average, create a
couple of variables.

18
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.870
And then we're gonna display the average.

19
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.790
Alright so let's save that.

20
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.366
Go back to our command prompt window, type

21
00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:21.925
newtontest2.py and we see that the average
is 138.5.

22
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.550
To demonstrate that that was the only
function that was brought

23
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.860
in, let's try to also display the square
root of nine.

24
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:31.960
Now watch what happens.

25
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.000
So it printed the, average is 138.5, but
then when we tried to compute

26
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.070
the square root, it gave us an error and
said square root is not defined.

27
00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.640
That's because we didn't, import, it into
our program.

28
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.700
Let's say we want to, work with both the
average function, and the square function.

29
00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.940
Here we, can add a comma, and then the
next function that we want, square.

30
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.180
After average.

31
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.400
So now we're saying, from the newton
module,

32
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.410
import, just the average function, and the
square function.

33
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.480
So, let's modify this program a little
bit.

34
00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.735
I'll just make comments here.

35
00:02:14.735 --> 00:02:21.699
Let's say avg = average(num1.

36
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:23.480
Num 2, so

37
00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.890
now we can compute the square of the
average,

38
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:41.179
like so so let's, save the program, let's
clear the screen.

39
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.430
And so we have the average, and then the
square of the average.

40
00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:53.970
So, to summarize, we can import only the
functions, that we want from a module,

41
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.040
by specifying them instead of the asterisk
to import all the functions.

42
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.050
So, for example, if I wanted just the
average function,.

43
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.930
I would write, from newton import average,
and if I wanted

44
00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:12.340
average and square, I would write, from
newton, import average and square.

45
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.030
So with that, we wrap this lesson on
[UNKNOWN] to find modules and we are

46
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.130
ready to move to the next lesson where we
are going to talk about module.

47
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.170
Namespaces.
