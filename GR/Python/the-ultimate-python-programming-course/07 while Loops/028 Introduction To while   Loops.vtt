1
00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:06.310
In this chapter we're going to introduce
the subject of loops, and a loop is just a

2
00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.600
way in Python to execute a number of
statements over and over again.

3
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.094
First of all, let me show you the general
form of the

4
00:00:14.094 --> 00:00:17.412
first type of loop we're going to study
and that's the while loop.

5
00:00:17.412 --> 00:00:21.312
I'm going to open up a note pad, follow,
and the while loop

6
00:00:21.312 --> 00:00:25.992
works like this we start with the keyword
while followed by a relational

7
00:00:25.992 --> 00:00:30.204
expression of some type and then inside
the body of the while loop

8
00:00:30.204 --> 00:00:34.637
will be a set of statements one or more
usually just one statement.

9
00:00:34.637 --> 00:00:38.070
And I'll explain why when we look at a
specific example here in just a minute.

10
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.872
So the concept behind a while loop is,

11
00:00:41.872 --> 00:00:45.436
is that while the value of the relational
expression

12
00:00:45.436 --> 00:00:48.838
is true, execute the statement inside the
body of

13
00:00:48.838 --> 00:00:52.178
the loop and it's no more difficult than
that.

14
00:00:52.178 --> 00:00:57.180
There are several kinds of while loops, we
are going to be looking at.

15
00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.930
The 2 we're going to study primarily

16
00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.490
are called count controlled, where we
execute the

17
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.610
statements in a loop a number of

18
00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.230
times, a predetermined usually normally
number of times.

19
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:13.020
And then also event controlled loops were
the statements in the loop

20
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.640
body are executed until an event occurs,
or while a event is occurring.

21
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.800
We're going o study these in more details
both of these types of loops.

22
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.870
But first of all lets just look at a

23
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.440
simple example of how a loop is written
and executed.

24
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.408
So we're going to create a script, we'll
call it

25
00:01:32.408 --> 00:01:36.690
while intro .py will be the name of our
program.

26
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:42.170
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna
display the numbers one through ten.

27
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.460
I know that's not very practical, but it
gives

28
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.340
me a chance to introduce the parts of a
loop

29
00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.790
in a very simple example, so you're not
too

30
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.450
distracted by what kind of computation I'm
trying to perform.

31
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.080
So the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna introduce a variable

32
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.900
and assign it the value one, and we'll say
number is our variable.

33
00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.780
And so, what we want to do is print the
numbers

34
00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.550
one through ten so we're going to say
while number is

35
00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.240
less than or equal to ten, and then we
have a

36
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.700
colon to indicate we're going into the
body of the loop.

37
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:22.740
Then we want to print the value of number
and then we want to

38
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:28.680
increment number by one to where right
number is number plus one.

39
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.500
Before we run this, let's exam the parts.

40
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.520
Here's our relational expression, while
number is less than or equal to ten.

41
00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.890
So that's the condition that we're looking
for.

42
00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.720
Then we print the value of number, and
then we increment number by one.

43
00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.080
This last line is very important because
in a count control

44
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.310
loop, which is what this is, but in any
type of loop,.

45
00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.950
There must be sort of statement that will
eventually cause your relational

46
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.320
expression to be false, otherwise the loop
will just run and run and run.

47
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.600
Lets call that infinite loop.

48
00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.910
So, this statement number is equal to
number plus 1.

49
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:19.717
As we go through the values of number from
1 to 10, eventually number will become 11.

50
00:03:19.717 --> 00:03:22.405
And when number has the value 11, it

51
00:03:22.405 --> 00:03:26.437
will make this relational expression
number less than or

52
00:03:26.437 --> 00:03:32.543
equal to 10 become false because, of
course 11 is not less than or equal to 10.

53
00:03:32.543 --> 00:03:34.586
So let's run the loop to see how it works.

54
00:03:34.586 --> 00:03:37.937
We'll exit and save.

55
00:03:37.937 --> 00:03:43.070
Then we type in the name of the script or
program and there's our values

56
00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:48.116
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 and of course, going

57
00:03:48.116 --> 00:03:53.520
back and looking at the code again right
here we see what happened.

58
00:03:53.520 --> 00:04:00.160
Numbers 1, so we check the expression one
is indeed less than or equal to ten.

59
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:06.550
So we print number increment number by one
go back and test again

60
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:12.000
and two is less than or equal to ten so we
print number, increment number by one.

61
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.700
Now number is three.

62
00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.610
We go back and check the expression again,
and

63
00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:19.310
we continue to do that until number
becomes 11.

64
00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.450
At that point, 11 less than or equal to 10
is

65
00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:28.470
false, so we drop out of the loop to the
next statement.

66
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.420
There are no more statements, so the
program

67
00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:35.390
stops, and the program stops printing
after 10.

68
00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.120
So that's our introduction to the while
loop.

69
00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.700
And now we are ready to move to the next
lesson where we

70
00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:45.060
are going to examine in a little more
detail, the count controlled group.
