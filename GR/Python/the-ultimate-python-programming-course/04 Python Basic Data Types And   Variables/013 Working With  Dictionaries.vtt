00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:02.700
In this brief lesson, we're going to talk

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.880
about yet, another Python data structure,
the dictionary.

3
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.400
A dictionary is exactly what you think of.

4
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.900
It's a way to look up, a value based on a
key.

5
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.500
Just like Webster's Dictionary or any
other dictionary.

6
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.370
We're going to use the interactive shell

7
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.850
again, to demonstrate how dictionaries are
created.

8
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.540
So let's open the shell first of all.

9
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.880
This first example will demonstrate how to
create an empty dictionary, and we

10
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.460
do that by writing an open curly brace
followed by a closing curly brace.

11
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.010
That creates an empty dictionary.

12
00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.730
But of course, that's not of much use.

13
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.250
So let's see how to create, a dictionary
that actually has data in it.

14
00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.560
What we're gonna do is we're gonna create
a little simple phone extension list.

15
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.070
We'll call it phone list.

16
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.270
And it's going to have an employee's name
followed by their extension.

17
00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.750
So we open the dictionary with an open
curly brace.

18
00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.770
We type the first key followed by a colon,
and then a value and then a

19
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:09.740
comma, then another key, colon, another
value, and

20
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.870
we'll do one more key and one more value,
like so.

21
00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.890
And that's all there is to it.

22
00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.730
If I want to retrieve a value I just write
a key as an index.

23
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.280
So, if I type in phone list Jane, it
returns

24
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.380
233, and that's as simple as a Python
dictionary is.

25
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.400
One thing I will show you before we leave
this subject, is you can

26
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.320
get a list of all the keys and all the
values of a dictionary.

27
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.490
By using the keys function which returns
the keys,

28
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.550
and the values function which returns all
the values.

29
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.970
There's a lot more we can talk about the
dictionaries, but we'll save that for

30
00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.770
later in the course when we'll learn

31
00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.880
a little bit more about Python programming
constructs.

32
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.220
So we'll leave dictionaries for now, we'll
move to the

33
00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.250
last data structure for the chapter and
that's the duple.
