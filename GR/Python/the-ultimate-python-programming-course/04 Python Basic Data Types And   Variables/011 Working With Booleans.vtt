1
00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:04.130
In this lesson, we're going to talk about
the Boolean data type.

2
00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.310
This will be a very short lesson because
we really can't talk

3
00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.070
much about the Boolean without talking

4
00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.750
about the relational and logical
operators.

5
00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.220
And I wanna save that for the lessons when

6
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.330
we start talking about if statements and
decision making.

7
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:18.890
So here I'm just gonna introduce you to

8
00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.760
the standard Boolean types, show you how
they're

9
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.470
generated then we'll talk much more about
how

10
00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.790
to generate Boolean data in a later
chapter.

11
00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.090
So we'll open the interactive shell, and
of

12
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.020
course the Boolean data types are true and
false.

13
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.180
Internally, true is represented as a one,
the

14
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.540
integer one, and false is represented as a
zero.

15
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.390
So for example, if I write an expression
like this, which may or may not make sense

16
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:54.110
to you, bool equals 2 is equal to 2, or
more precisely, the result

17
00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:00.960
of comparing 2 equal to 2, is assigned to
bool, will result in a value true

18
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.350
being displayed, but internally it's
really a 1

19
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.720
and then there's some display logic that
displays

20
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:08.720
the true instead of the 1.

21
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.640
So we can turn around and say, and then
display bool and you

22
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.920
see that now bool is false because 2 is
not equal to 3.

23
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.806
So there's really not much else to say at
this point about the Boolean

24
00:01:21.806 --> 00:01:25.940
data type other than that there is a true
value and a false value.

25
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.420
It's generated when we make comparisons

26
00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.330
using relational operators, and logical
operators also.

27
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.390
We're gonna talk more about those in a
later chapter.

28
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.890
Internally, true is stored as a one, the
integer

29
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.880
one, and false is stored as the integer
zero.

30
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.610
I demonstrated how to generate a billion
value.

31
00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.950
You can also do them of course directly on
expression.

32
00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:48.810
We saw that earlier.

33
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.290
Just like so.

34
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.540
So that's really all we're going to say
about Boolean

35
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.580
data type right now, and as I've mentioned
several times already,

36
00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.080
we'll be talking a lot more about Boolean
data when

37
00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.600
we get to the chapter on decision making
and if statements.

38
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.780
So we're gonna wrap up this short lesson

39
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.690
now, move on to the next lesson, where
we're

40
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.820
going to go from data types to data
structures,

41
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.560
and start by talking about the list data
structure.
