1
00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:02.330
In this chapter we're going to be

2
00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.900
studying, how to make decisions using if
statements.

3
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.270
We're gonna start out this first lesson by
looking at the way we make comparisons.

4
00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:14.010
And that's using what are called the
Comparison or Relational Operators.

5
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:15.760
So let's take a look at those.

6
00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.500
We're gonna do it, in this lesson in the
interactive shell, start that first.

7
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.010
So, the first of the operators is the
equals operator, or, is equal to.

8
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:26.630
And it's a very simple one.

9
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.500
It's a double equals sign.

10
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.700
You'll notice that we put two values on
either side.

11
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.210
So we call it a binary operator, cuz it

12
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.330
needs a left hand side and a right hand
side.

13
00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.840
And so we compare two values to see if
they're equal.

14
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.390
So clearly, 100 is equal to 100 so it
returns true.

15
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.170
So the relational operators, return a
boolean value, either true or false.

16
00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.860
So for example 100 equals 200, will return
false.

17
00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:59.460
It works just as well with strings, hello
equals hello returns true.

18
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.660
Hello equals goodbye, equals false.

19
00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.780
And then finally, hello equals hello with
a capital H,

20
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.060
returns false, because, these two strings
are not exactly the same.

21
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:20.340
So after equality we have greater than,
100 greater than 1, returns true.

22
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.070
A, greater than b, returns false, because
b is actually greater

23
00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.140
than a, in what's called lexographic
order, as you see there.

24
00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.210
Then we have greater than or equal to, so

25
00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.630
100 greater than or equal to 100 returns
true a.

26
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.030
Greater than or equal to b, returns false.

27
00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.660
Then we have less than, 100 less than 1,
returns false.

28
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:53.830
0 less than a 100, returns true, h less
than h, returns false.

29
00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.190
And a less then b.

30
00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.590
Returns true.

31
00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.270
Next is less than or equal to.

32
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.550
So we have, 1 less than or equal to 1

33
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:08.480
returns true, b less than or equal to c
returns true.

34
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:12.050
100 less than or equal to 1 returns false.

35
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.480
Then finally we have not equal to.

36
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.390
100 not equal to 1 returns true.

37
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.500
Hello not equal to hello returns false.

38
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.740
So those are the relational operators, at
least

39
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.160
the 1 we'll be studying in this chapter.

40
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.030
We has is equal to, greater than, greater
than

41
00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.280
or equal to, less than, less than or equal
to.

42
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.080
And not equal to.

43
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.140
And the thing we have to remember about
the relational

44
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.080
operators, is they are binary operators,
so they require two operands.

45
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.610
And they return a boolean value.

46
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.900
So with that in mind, we're ready to move
to the next

47
00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.030
lesson, where we're going to be

48
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.520
talking about ways to combine relational
expressions.

49
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.680
So for example, hello equals to hello is a
relational expression.

50
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.440
We have another set of operators called

51
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.340
the Logical or Boolean operators, that
allow us

52
00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.260
to combine two or more relational
expressions, and

53
00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.390
return a single Boolean value from those
expressions.

54
00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.190
And we're going to look at those operators
in the next lesson.
