00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:03.700
For this last exercise of chapter six,
we're going

2
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.990
to demonstrate, again, how to use the if
elif.

3
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.620
This time we're going to write a little
program

4
00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.320
that suggests activities at a resort based
on the

5
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.450
temperature, so that if you're sitting in
your room

6
00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.080
with a computer, you could type in the
temperature.

7
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.120
And then the program would give you some
suggestions of things to do.

8
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.240
So let's get started on that.

9
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.880
We're going to call it activity.py.

10
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.820
First thing I'm going to do is write a
stock message that

11
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.040
will fill in, based on what the user
enters for the temperature.

12
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.990
So we'll prompt the user to enter the
temperature now.

13
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:43.530
And then we'll get that using the int
conversion function and raw input.

14
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.220
And now we begin the if elif.

15
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.020
So, we say, if temp is greater than

16
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.800
85, message is equal to message plus,
swimming.

17
00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.901
Elif the temp is greater than or equal to
70,.

18
00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.620
Then we suggests that tennis is the right
activity.

19
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.820
Elif the temp is greater than or equal to
32.

20
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.120
The recommended activity is golf all
though 32 may be

21
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.880
a little bit cold for golf we'll leave it
there.

22
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.590
Elif the temp.

23
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.368
Is greater than or equal to zero, then the
recommended activity is dancing.

24
00:01:25.368 --> 00:01:31.660
And otherwise, else, the recommended

25
00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:37.150
activity will be sitting by the fire, and
then we'll just simply print the message.

26
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.120
And we're finished.

27
00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.710
Scanning the code I see a left alpha colon
right here so

28
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.160
let's add that in, and the left one off
right here also.

29
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.290
Now I believe we're ready.

30
00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.440
So exit and save.

31
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.610
And then run the program.

32
00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.540
So let's say the temperature is 56.

33
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.210
The recommended activity is golf.

34
00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.910
Let's run it again, let's say it's 99,
then the recommended activity is swimming.

35
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.290
Let's say it's 72, then we have tennis.

36
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.300
Let's say it's 23, then dancing.

37
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.700
And then we're in the far northern climbs,
and the temperatures negative 10.

38
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.460
The recommend activity is sitting by the
fire.

39
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:36.300
So there's another example of how to use
the if elif to make decisions based on

40
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:42.630
a series of related possibilities based on
the input data that the program receives.

41
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.980
And with this we're ready to end this
chapter on decision making and

42
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.790
we're ready to move on to the next chapter
where we're going to talk

43
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.420
about writing loops, in this case we're
going to talk about the Wyle loop,

44
00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.240
which is the first of the types of loops
we're going to talk about.
