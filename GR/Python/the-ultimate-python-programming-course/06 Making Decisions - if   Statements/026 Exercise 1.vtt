00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:03.260
For this first exercise of the chapter,
we're going to

2
00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.370
write a program to play a simple little
guessing game.

3
00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.160
So let me make sure I don't have my
previous version up here.

4
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.070
Okay, so it's gone.

5
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.072
So we're going to call our program
guess.py.

6
00:00:13.072 --> 00:00:14.530
So let's open it up.

7
00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:16.720
So the first thing we're gonna do is store

8
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.820
the answer to the game in a variable
answer.

9
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:20.880
And the answer is Watson.

10
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.500
And in a moment you'll find out what the
question is.

11
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.120
First we're gonna tell the user that we're

12
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.430
gonna play a guessing and they get three
tries.

13
00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:35.380
Then we're gonna say what is the name of
the computer that played on Jeopardy.

14
00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.280
So the first thing we do is get the user's
response.

15
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.810
We'll store it in a variable called
Response.

16
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.020
Using raw input.

17
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.900
Now here's where we test.

18
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:50.098
We say, if response, equals answer, print,
that is right.

19
00:00:50.098 --> 00:00:55.360
Else, print, sorry guess again.

20
00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:01.350
Then we say, response equals wrong input,
then we test again.

21
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.120
So here we're nesting an if statement
inside the else, or actually in the if.

22
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.960
These are called nested if statements.

23
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.756
If response is equal to answer, then we
tell the user that they're right.

24
00:01:12.756 --> 00:01:19.430
Otherwise, else print, sorry, one more
guess.

25
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:21.850
Again.

26
00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.500
Responds equals raw input.

27
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.320
And if there's font's is equal to the
answer.

28
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.220
Print.

29
00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:30.992
That is right.

30
00:01:30.992 --> 00:01:39.132
[UNKNOWN]
print, sorry no more guess'.

31
00:01:39.132 --> 00:01:42.800
The answer is.

32
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:49.000
And we'll just use the variable value
answer plus a period.

33
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.610
Let's test this and see how well it works.

34
00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.140
So we'll do an Exit>Save, clear the
screen.

35
00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.726
And then run the script.

36
00:01:57.726 --> 00:02:02.550
Let's say, Deep Blue.

37
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.100
It's not Deep Blue okay it's Bob oh that's
right

38
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.100
it's Watson so on the 3rd try I got it
right

39
00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.060
play again this time we'll get it on the
first try

40
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:21.010
let's play it again we'll say Eniac then
we'll say Watson.

41
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.600
One more time and this time let's not get
it right at all.

42
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.780
Eniac.

43
00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:26.280
Sorry.

44
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:33.060
Blue, Joe, Sorry no more guesses the
answer is Watson.

45
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.940
So here we've used the is statement.

46
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.510
the ifel statement in a nested manner to
allow the user 3 guesses.

47
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.330
a better way to write this program would
have

48
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.170
been to use a loop that looped through
three times.

49
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.870
But we haven't learned how to write loops
yet.

50
00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.670
We're gonna learn how to do that in the
next chapter.

51
00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.350
So this was the best way I could think of
to

52
00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.080
write this program and demonstrate how to
use nested if else statements.

53
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.790
With that we're finished this exercise and
we're ready to move on to the next

54
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.830
and last exercise for this chapter where
we demonstrate how to work with the if.

55
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:09.930
L if statement.

56
00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.129
