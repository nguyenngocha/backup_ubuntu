00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:04.755
In the last lesson we saw how to write a
simple if statement.

2
00:00:04.755 --> 00:00:08.100
An example that we used was a payroll
example where we perform

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.160
one calculation if the number of hours
worked was greater than 40.

4
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.510
And then we had a separate if statement
that checked to see if the number of

5
00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.650
hours worked were less than or equal to

6
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.870
40, in which case, yet another calculation
was performed.

7
00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:23.990
Having two if statements related like that
is usually not necessary.

8
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.780
What you can do instead is write what's
called an if-else statement.

9
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.086
And let's take a look at the abstract
version of that, then we'll go

10
00:00:31.086 --> 00:00:34.870
back into the program from last lesson and
then modify it using an if-else.

11
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.516
The way you write the if-else is you have
the if followed by

12
00:00:37.516 --> 00:00:41.525
the relational expression, followed by the
set of statements that will be executed.

13
00:00:41.525 --> 00:00:43.610
Then you have else, followed by a colon,
followed by the set of statements that

14
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:56.890
you want to have executed, if the if part
of the statement is false.

15
00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.350
So, in other words, here's how the if else
statement works.

16
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.930
The relational expression is tested.

17
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.570
If it's true, then the statements in the
body of

18
00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.540
the if are executed and control falls
outside of the else.

19
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.450
To where my cursor is, in other words.

20
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.010
If the relational expression is false,
then the statements after the else

21
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:27.890
are automatically executed and then
control falls down out of the If-Else.

22
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.370
So one set of statements is executed if
the relational expression is true.

23
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:37.310
A second set of statements is executed if
the relational expression is false.

24
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.010
But by doing it this way, we don't have to
write a

25
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:45.130
separate if that would be covered in this
case by the else.

26
00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.650
Alright, so lets go back and look at the
program from before.

27
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.670
It was ifstatement.py.

28
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.010
And all we have to do to modify that is

29
00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.150
take out the if and replace it with an
else.

30
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:06.700
So, now we're saying, if hour worked is
greater than 40, execute this statement.

31
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.980
Otherwise, else, execute this statement.

32
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.020
So let's exit and save, and then run the
program and see what it does.

33
00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.520
So, we'll type if statement.py.

34
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.770
So let's do it where the if is true.

35
00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.590
Now let's run it again and this time let's
run it with the else.

36
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.840
So we get the very same result as we got
before, but we do it without

37
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.620
having to actually perform yet a second
relational expression test.

38
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.020
In other words, we don't have to test to
see

39
00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.540
if hours worked is less than or equal to
40.

40
00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.180
If this expression is false, then
execution is transferred

41
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.310
immediately to the statement inside the
else and it's executed.

42
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:58.040
So now we've seen two of the three types
of if statements, the if, the if-else

43
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.360
and now the third type which is performed

44
00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.560
if we have several relational expressions
to test.

45
00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.640
And that's called the if-l-if, and we're
going to

46
00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.240
see how to do that in the next lesson.
