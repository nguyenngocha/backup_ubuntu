1
00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.920
The third type of if statement in Python
is the if elif.

2
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.900
Let me demonstrate the general syntax for
that if statement.

3
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.110
So we have if followed by a relational
expression.

4
00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.770
Inside that would be the statements.

5
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.070
And then you'll say, elif and another
relational expression.

6
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.090
Followed by a set of statements, one or
more.

7
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.530
And we can continue with elifs as long as
we need to.

8
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:28.890
And we'll stop after this one.

9
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.740
And then finally, you can have an optional
else.

10
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:39.220
The else will execute its statements if,
and we left off a colon right there.

11
00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.100
If all of the other relational expressions
are false.

12
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.300
So an example of when you might need a if
elif is with

13
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.700
a grading scale, when you're taking
numeric scores and assigning values.

14
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:58.670
So for example, greater than 89 is a
letter grade A, using the 90 to 100 scale.

15
00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.440
80 to 89 is a B, 70 to 79 is a C,

16
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.350
60 to 69 is a D, and anything below

17
00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:14.390
60, so less than or equal to 59, is an F.

18
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.070
So if you're looking at a numeric score,
you might

19
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.600
say, if grade is greater than 89, letter
grade equals A.

20
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.580
Elif grade is greater than 79, or greater

21
00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.440
than or equal to 80, letter grade equals
B.

22
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:37.120
Elif grade is greater than or equal to 70,
letter grade equals C and so on.

23
00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.930
In fact, let's look in Python how to
actually write

24
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.560
that simple little program to demonstrate
how the if elif works.

25
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.335
So let's move to Python.

26
00:01:48.335 --> 00:01:52.426
We'll call this ifelif.py.

27
00:01:52.426 --> 00:01:56.490
So the first thing we're gonna do is say
print, enter a numeric grade.

28
00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.500
And then we'll say grade is equal to int,
raw input.

29
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.810
And then we'll say if grade is greater

30
00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.680
than or equal to 90, letter grade equals
A.

31
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.950
Elif, and actually I'm gonna take the
parenthesis off this.

32
00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.360
If you come from another programming
language in to Python, you'd be

33
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.380
like me and want to always put parentheses
around your relational expressions.

34
00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.320
That's not a common idiom in Python, so
trying to follow

35
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.580
the convention of most Python programmers,
I'll take my parentheses off.

36
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:33.850
It's hard for me to do.

37
00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:40.701
Then we can say, elif grade greater than
or equal to 80, letter grade equals B.

38
00:02:40.701 --> 00:02:47.911
Elif grade greater than, equal to 70,
letter grade equals C.

39
00:02:47.911 --> 00:02:53.290
Elif grade greater than, equal to 60,
letter grade equals D.

40
00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:00.600
Elif grade less than, equal to 59, letter
grade equal F.

41
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:06.490
Else print did not recognize input.

42
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.360
We'll add this else part for if the user
enters something that's not

43
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.028
in that range or enters some input that's
not a number, for example.

44
00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:22.190
So I have print statement and print and
say your letter grade is, letter grade.

45
00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.490
Okay?

46
00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.310
So let's exit and save.

47
00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:30.489
And try it, ifelif.py.

48
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.310
I haven't made too many error; this one is
just a typographical error.

49
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.080
I do like to leave them in because you'll
see how I solve these problems.

50
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.000
This is an easy one to fix; I just forgot
to put the

51
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.040
colon right here, so let's add that in
real quick, exit and save again.

52
00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:51.890
Chock full of mistakes today.

53
00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:53.950
Same thing right there.

54
00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:57.630
One more time.

55
00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.060
That's the end of the program, so there
shouldn't be too many other errors.

56
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.890
So let's just try a middle grade, 77.

57
00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:05.510
Your letter grade is C.

58
00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:06.780
Let's run it again.

59
00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.890
Let's try a high score.

60
00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:09.580
That's good.

61
00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:10.910
Let's run it again.

62
00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:11.490
Let's try.

63
00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.925
Now let's try for one more attempt.

64
00:04:14.925 --> 00:04:18.310
Let's try something that's outside the
range, let's try a letter.

65
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:23.670
In that case, it failed in our input,
which is fine, just trying to show

66
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:25.860
you what would happen if the user

67
00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.300
entered something that was not a
legitimate number.

68
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.130
Later in the course, we'll talk more about
how a handle errors like this.

69
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.340
But I just wanted to demonstrate what
would happen

70
00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.840
if the user entered something outside the
range of numbers.

71
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:43.420
So to review very quickly, we've looked at
the if elif statement as a way to make one

72
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:49.520
decision based on a large range of
possible values of the input.

73
00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.060
And so the example that we used was

74
00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.810
turning a numeric grade into a letter
grade.

75
00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.070
In the exercises, we'll look at another
example of using if

76
00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.430
elif, and in fact, we're ready to move to
the exercises now.

77
00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.300
Our first exercise will involve just if
else, but later

78
00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.690
on in the exercises, we will work again
with if elif.

79
00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.710
So let's move on to the exercises.

80
00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:15.329
