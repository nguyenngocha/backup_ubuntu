00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.480
In this lesson we're going to look at

2
00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.240
the first of three different types of if
statements.

3
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.120
We're gonna call this the simple if.

4
00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.150
So I'm gonna use Notepad here kind of like
a white board.

5
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.370
So the way we form the simple if in Python

6
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.080
is, we write the keyword, if, followed by
a relational expression.

7
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.290
After the relational expression, we put a
colon.

8
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.480
The colon signifies that we're now ready
to start the body of the if.

9
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.580
The body of the if has to be indented a
couple of spaces, two or three, up to tab.

10
00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.270
I don't like to use tab, but you can use
tab.

11
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:40.190
And then, inside the indention is where
you'll put Python statements of any type.

12
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.310
Of course you can also have more than one
relational expressions, you

13
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:49.540
could have RE1 followed by a logical
operator, followed by the statements.

14
00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:55.780
And of course you could have RE1 or RE2,
followed by the statements.

15
00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.460
The way the if statement works is that the
relational expression is tested.

16
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.970
If the relational expression is true.

17
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.460
Then the statements inside the body, in

18
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.290
other words, indented from the if, are
executed.

19
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.090
And they're only executed if the
relational expression is true.

20
00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.480
So in the next two examples, the whole
statement must be true, just like with

21
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:25.380
the or, must be true in order for the
statement or statements to be executed.

22
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.520
And that's all there is to it.

23
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.130
So let's look at an example in Python.

24
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.600
So let's minimize that.

25
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.640
Bring up out window.

26
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.560
Clear the screen.

27
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.550
We'll work in Python three at this time.

28
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.220
We're gonna write a script for this.

29
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.720
We're not gonna do it interactively.

30
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.630
So we're gonna call this ifstatement.py.

31
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.200
Let me adjust it on the screen here.

32
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.740
Just a bit.

33
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:49.622
There we go.

34
00:01:49.622 --> 00:01:52.095
All right, so to demonstrate how the if
statements

35
00:01:52.095 --> 00:01:54.770
works, we're going to write a simple
payroll program.

36
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.740
So we'll ask the user enter the number of
hours worked.

37
00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.250
And we'll store it in a variable
hoursWorked.

38
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.140
We'll assign the rate although we could
ask for the rate also,

39
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.170
just to make this program a little
simpler, I'll assign the rate.

40
00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.620
Now here's where our if statement comes
in.

41
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.840
We would say if hours worked is greater
than 40 followed by

42
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.630
the colon then I drop down to the next
line and I indent.

43
00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.829
Then I'll say, grossPay =

44
00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:30.329
(40 * rate) +

45
00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:36.030
plus the number of hours worked, minus 40,
times

46
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.650
the rate times 1.5 to represent time and a
half.

47
00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.720
If, on the other hand, the hours worked is
less than or equal to 40, then

48
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:55.000
gross pay is equal to the hours worked
times the rate, just as simple as that.

49
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.780
Then we can print gross pay, and remember
to decatenate

50
00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.520
a numeric value we have to convert it to
string.

51
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.420
So we'll convert it to string to display
it.

52
00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.210
So there's our program, or script.

53
00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.500
So let's Exit and Save.

54
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.400
Then we'll run our script.

55
00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.750
So it says, Enter the hours worked.

56
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:16.380
Let's enter 45.

57
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.400
And then it computes the Gross Pay.

58
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.728
Let's run it again.

59
00:03:21.728 --> 00:03:25.060
This time, lets set the hours worked to
20,

60
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.080
and 20 times 25 is 500, so that's correct.

61
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:35.600
So looking at the program again one more
time, we see how the if statement worked.

62
00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.330
The program looks at this relational
expression

63
00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.390
and decides whether it's true or false.

64
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:41.850
If it's true.

65
00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.420
Then it executes the statement below,
otherwise it does nothing.

66
00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.010
Then it moves down to the next

67
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.120
if statement, and analyzes this relational
expression.

68
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.710
If hoursWorked is less than or equal

69
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:56.300
to 40, then it executes this statement
instead.

70
00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.720
It's possible that we really don't need to
have two

71
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.340
relational expressions tested, because
either hoursWorked is greater than 40.

72
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.220
Or it's less than or equal to 40.

73
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.070
So in that case, we want to use the second

74
00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.540
version of the if statement called the If
Else statement.

75
00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.480
And we're going to see how to do that in
the next lesson.
