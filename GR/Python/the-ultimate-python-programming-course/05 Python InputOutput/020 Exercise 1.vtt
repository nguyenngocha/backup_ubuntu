1
00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:05.700
In this exercise we're going to create an
interactive thank you note program.

2
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.930
The program will ask the user to enter the
name of

3
00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.990
the gift giver, the present they were
given, how old the

4
00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.360
user was on their last birthday, and what
their name is,

5
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.170
and then it's going to print out a thank
you note.

6
00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.060
So let's get started.

7
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.370
We'll call this, thanks.py.

8
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:27.740
So the first thing we're gonna say is what
is the name of the gift giver and

9
00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.380
then we get their name in with raw input
and we'll ask what the present was and

10
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:38.890
we'll ask them how old they were.

11
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:45.980
You're ready to convert raw input into
int, so we use that function first.

12
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:46.480
And

13
00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.480
then finally we ask, what is your name?

14
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.090
So that we can sign the card.

15
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.910
We'll call that variable yourName.

16
00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.820
So then the first thing we're going to do.

17
00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:01.540
Is we'll say.

18
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.600
Then we'll put a blank line, and we'll say
thank you

19
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.740
for the present, and then a period, and a
space,

20
00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.910
and then we'll say print, I really like
it.

21
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.900
I'm gonna say, I can't believe.

22
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.330
And then space enclose.

23
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.980
And then say print, I am already.

24
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.080
Here we're gonna convert age to a string.

25
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:42.920
And a space then say print, it does not
feel like.

26
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.500
Different than being and we'll go on to
the next slide.

27
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.030
Print

28
00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:58.010
string age minus 1, plus, so then we'll
print a blank line.

29
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.920
And we'll say print Sincerely.

30
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.850
Space there doesn't really matter cuz
we're gonna drop down a line.

31
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.000
Put a space and then say print.

32
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.820
Your name.

33
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:12.320
Okay.

34
00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.920
We may have to do some adjustments to the
output.

35
00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.250
But the input should be good.

36
00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.470
So let's save and run the program and see
how it looks.

37
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.860
So we'll say the gift giver is Aunt Jean.

38
00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.460
She gave a sweater.

39
00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.560
Age is 13.

40
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.450
Name is Barbara.

41
00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.740
So that output looks reasonable.

42
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.280
We can quibble over how the lines

43
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.420
are displayed exactly, but that's besides
the point.

44
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.550
We could put the 12 up on the previous
line.

45
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.820
Or drop being down to the next line,
however we want to do that.

46
00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.400
But we'll leave it like it is and you can
adjust it if you want to.

47
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.870
So that wraps up this exercise on using
print and

48
00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.300
raw input and we're ready to move on to
the

49
00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.650
next chapter where we're going to learn
how to may

50
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.480
decisions in Python using different
variations of the If statement.
