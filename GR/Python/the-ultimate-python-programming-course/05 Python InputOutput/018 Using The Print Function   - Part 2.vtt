00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:06.930
In this lesson we're going to see how to
redirect print from the screen to a file.

2
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.190
So we're going to work in the interactive
shell again, so let's open that.

3
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.540
So in the last lesson we saw that printing
to the screen, we use the print function

4
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.210
and we put the data we want to

5
00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.000
print inside parenthesis as the argument
to the function.

6
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.720
A primitive way to perform the same
function is to import the sys library.

7
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.990
We haven't talked about importing
libraries yet,

8
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.690
but like most modern languages Python has
a

9
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.430
series of libraries which bring added
functionality

10
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.930
to the, fundamental language or the basic
language.

11
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.250
By doing this, we keep the language small,
the core

12
00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.480
language small, which increases efficiency
and productivity of the language.

13
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.850
And then we need additional functionality,
we simply import the library that we need.

14
00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.090
So to see how the print function works, we
have import the sys library.

15
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.790
To get at one of the objects of that
library, standard out.

16
00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.370
Then it has a function right.

17
00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:13.020
In this case we wanna put a new line in
there to write out data to the screen.

18
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.030
So, the print function is just a

19
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.680
easier way of doing import sys,
sys.standard out.write.

20
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.330
And then the data that you wanna write out
to the screen.

21
00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.070
But with this in mind we can redefine
standard out.

22
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.980
It's just by default going to the screen,
but we can redefine it.

23
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.480
We do that by referencing the objects as a
sta, standard

24
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.260
out and then we open a file that we wanna
use.

25
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.695
So, we'll say, we'll call this.

26
00:01:38.695 --> 00:01:42.500
Text.dat and we'll open it to append.

27
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.810
So now when we say print hello notice it
didn't print anything on the screen.

28
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.790
And if we exit out of the shell and type
out the file using the dos command

29
00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.760
Type we'll see that our text, hello, went
to the file instead of the screen.

30
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.250
And every other time that we use the print
command in

31
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:08.710
that session then it would have sent that
output to the file.

32
00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.510
Now we close the session by typing exit.

33
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.900
So now when we open up the shell again, we
haven't redirected

34
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.379
output, the sys.standard out, so it's
still going to the right place.

35
00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.610
Let's do it again,

36
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:23.823
[BLANK_AUDIO]

37
00:02:23.823 --> 00:02:24.570
like so.

38
00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.540
So once again, our output with print is
going to the file and not to the screen.

39
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.620
So a better way to redirect output, is

40
00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.510
to rather than redefine sys.standard out,
is to redirect.

41
00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.450
Where print goes when we issue the print

42
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.100
command and here's how we're going to do
that.

43
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.920
First thing we need to do is we need to
define a text object or create a new file.

44
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.830
Open it for a pending and then any data
that we want to print to that

45
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.790
file we want to use print and then

46
00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.950
redirect it using the double greater than
sign.

47
00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.150
Through the text file, and then whatever
text we want to provide now goes there.

48
00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.790
And then if I say print, so now the

49
00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.900
print function, the default version prints
to the screen, and

50
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.820
when we want to print to a file, we
redirect

51
00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.070
it using the redirect operator, the double
greater than sign.

52
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.330
And say take the data the second argument
and send it to the file.

53
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.100
So that's the better way to do print
redirection in python.

54
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.920
So that's how you do it.

55
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.620
That's how you redirect print when you
don't wanna print to the screen.

56
00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.050
And that concludes this lesson and we're
ready to move to the last lesson of the

57
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.310
chapter where we're going to discuss how
to

58
00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.840
get input from the keyboard into our
python programs.
