1
00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:04.260
In this lesson we're going to discuss, how
to get

2
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.230
input from the user using a function
called Raw Input.

3
00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.270
So we're gonna use the interactive shell
first, so let's open that.

4
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.620
The way we use Raw Input is like so we
would, for example, create

5
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:22.130
a variable, and then assign it to the
output of the raw input function.

6
00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.200
So that if I type some data into Raw input

7
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.290
and then hit the enter key, the
interactive shell returns.

8
00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:34.110
And if I print the value of name, you'll
see that it displays Mary Smith.

9
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.640
So clearly raw input pauses the
interactive program

10
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.140
to wait for the user to enter input.

11
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.070
Once the user hits the enter key, then the
input is sent from

12
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.780
the function to the variable on the other
side of the assignment statement.

13
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.240
So string data is very simple to enter
with Raw input.

14
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.310
You can enter one word or you know a whole
sentence for example,

15
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.000
and again, it just keeps collecting input
until I hit the enter key.

16
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.310
Then it returns, and then whatever I typed
into the keyboard

17
00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:15.080
up into the inner key stroke is stored in
sentence.

18
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.220
We can also store numbers using raw input.

19
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.250
What will happen when I type number times
two?

20
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.930
It replicates the value stored in number,
whether then returning

21
00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.130
200, that's because the output from Raw
input, is string type.

22
00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:40.330
So if I want the data that Raw input
receives, converted to,

23
00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.610
in numeric type I have to provide a
function to do that.

24
00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.890
In this line I have used the int
conversion

25
00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:55.080
function to convert route inputs value to
int from string.

26
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.130
Now if I type print number times two it
prints the correct value, or

27
00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:05.070
what I expected to be the correct value
which is 200 rather than 100, 100.

28
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:13.070
If I'm working with floating point values,
I can use float as the conversion function

29
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.780
instead, and it will retrieve the data and
store it as a floating point number.

30
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.910
That I can then do floating point
operations

31
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.320
on it, without worrying about losing any
data.

32
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.020
So those are the primary uses of raw
input.

33
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.210
Certainly in this course, we'll mostly be
retrieving

34
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.930
strings and numbers from the user, using
raw input.

35
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.710
Let's look at one more example, that's a

36
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.930
script rather than just using the
interactive shell.

37
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.350
So we're gonna start a script.

38
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.750
So what we gonna do, is we're going to
prompt the user to enter some values.

39
00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.190
And then we'll convert them to integer
before we store them in the variable.

40
00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.440
So we'll do that a second time.

41
00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.940
And

42
00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.300
we're going to display the sum.

43
00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.690
Now, right here I have a problem, in that
I can't concatenate a number, which

44
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.186
is what we'll get when we add number one
with number two to a string.

45
00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.990
We've seen in previous lessons that, that
leads to an error.

46
00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.250
So, what I have to do is, I have to use
the string conversion function.

47
00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.100
To convert number one plus number two, to

48
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.890
stream format and then I can store the
result.

49
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:33.190
So let's exit and Save, and we'll just run
the script, three and four gives us seven.

50
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.780
So that's how you use raw input to
retrieve data from the user.

51
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.880
After they've typed in at the keyboard.

52
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.110
And now we're ready to move on to the
exercise for this chapter, where we're

53
00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:49.920
going to use print and raw input to create
an interactive thank you note.
