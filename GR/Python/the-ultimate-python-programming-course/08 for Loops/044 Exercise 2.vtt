00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.480
For the last exercise in this chapter
we're going to use

2
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.120
nested 4 loops to build a histogram of the
set of grades.

3
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.870
The grades are going to come from the
grades.text file we've been working with.

4
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.700
So let me display that file for you again.

5
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.480
Entered the wrong command, there we go.

6
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.940
I've mixed the grades up a little bit.

7
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.300
They were in numeric order.

8
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.750
I've mixed them up, but they're the same
grades that we worked with before.

9
00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.300
So what we want to do is loop through

10
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.940
the file, and for each grade create a
histogram.

11
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.080
Our histogram will be a series of
asterisks.

12
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.970
One asterisk for every five points of

13
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.280
a grade, because we can't really easily
display

14
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:48.390
100 or 93 asterisks on our screen so we're
gonna represent 5 points by 1 asterisk.

15
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.430
So let's get started with the program.

16
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.650
We're gonna call it Chap8ex2.py.

17
00:00:53.650 --> 00:01:00.590
We're going to use a variable named bar as
the variable to hold the asterisks.

18
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.830
So we're gonna set it equal to empty
string.

19
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:09.620
Then our first 4 loop will loop through
the grades file, grades.text.

20
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.020
Then the 2nd loop is going to loop over a
range,

21
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.570
starting at 1, and going through the total
grade plus 1.

22
00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.130
Again because we wanna be inclusive of the
actual number.

23
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.500
So if the grade is 93, we've got to go
into.

24
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.410
Grade plus one.

25
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.650
Then, the way we decide if we're going to
add a asterisk

26
00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.130
to our bar is we perform a modulus on the
i value.

27
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.620
So i modulus 5 is equal to 0, in other
words, if i

28
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.760
is evenly divided by 5 then that means we
can add a star.

29
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.170
To our bar variable or an asterisk.

30
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.220
I like to say star, easier to say.

31
00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.050
So that's what that line looks like right
there.

32
00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.380
So when we've gone all the way through and
added

33
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.480
all the bars we need or all the stars we
need.

34
00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.770
For our bar, then we're ready to print the
bar.

35
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.660
So we're gonna print the bar, and then we
also want to print

36
00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.840
the grade out, by it so we can see what
the actual number is.

37
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.220
And the last thing we need to do is, we
need to reset the

38
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.800
bar variable to the empty strain, to begin
collecting the next set of asterisk's.

39
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.590
So let's save it, and we're gonna run it.

40
00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:25.400
And there's our output.

41
00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.740
So as you see, we've used a set of two for
loops to recreate the bar chart.

42
00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.790
Here's the bar chart again.

43
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.110
And that will end this exercise, and that
ends this chapter on for loops.

44
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.810
We will look some of the other

45
00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.800
data structures that we covered in this
chapter,

46
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.510
later in the course, when we present a

47
00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:51.096
complete chapter on using lists,
dictionaries, and [UNKNOWN].
