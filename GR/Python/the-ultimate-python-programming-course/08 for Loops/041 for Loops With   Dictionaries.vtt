1
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:05.450
In this lesson, we're going to examine how
to use the for loop with a dictionary.

2
00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.720
So lets open up a new python program so we
can review how dictionaries work.

3
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.690
So there's our program, fordict.py.

4
00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.570
[BLANK_AUDIO]

5
00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.280
So, a dictionary involves storing key
value pairs.

6
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.850
So for example if I want to keep track of

7
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.090
a phone book, I might have a name and an
extension.

8
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.310
And so I'll have as many names and
extensions as I need.

9
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.060
I'm just going to do three for this
example.

10
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.770
And we'll stop there.

11
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.280
And remember that dictionaries are
delimited with curly braces.

12
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.230
An opening curly brace to begin the
dictionary,

13
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.270
and a closing curly brace to close the
dictionary.

14
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.370
If we want to display a value from a
dictionary,

15
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.850
we have to index into that value with a
key.

16
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.720
So, for example, if I wanna see Cynthia's
extension, I have to

17
00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:03.160
use Cynthia as the index into the
dictionary to display her extension.

18
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.220
So, let's take a look at that.

19
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:04.790
We'll save it.

20
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.240
Bring the command window up.

21
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.250
And there we see that her extension is
2356.

22
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:21.160
Also, remember that we can display both
the keys

23
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:27.890
in a dictionary and the values using the
keys and values function respectively.

24
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.730
So let's review how they work.

25
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.040
So the first list are my keys, and the
second list contains my values.

26
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.020
Let's clear the screen.

27
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.970
So now we've seen how to do that, let's
discuss

28
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.600
how we can use a for loop to display our
dictionary.

29
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:59.420
We can write for key in numbers.keys and
remember keys will return a list of keys.

30
00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.180
So this becomes our sequence that then, we
are going to

31
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.680
pull each key out and put it in the key
variable.

32
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.880
We can say print numbers sub-key.

33
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.780
Let's make our output a little more
reasonable.

34
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.920
We can say, key extension is, and then
number sub-key.

35
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.570
And so, that should print out each name
and

36
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.200
the value or the extension associated with
that value.

37
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.210
And there we go.

38
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.040
Cynthia extension is 2356.

39
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.640
Raymond extension is 2345.

40
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.985
David extension is 2373.

41
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.550
So this was a very quick lesson, but it's

42
00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.400
very useful because it's almost a given
that when

43
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.900
you set up a dictionary you're gonna want
to

44
00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.920
display all the values in that dictionary
based on keys.

45
00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.500
And to do that all you have to do is set

46
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.430
up a very simple for loop where you
sequence the keys

47
00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.150
and then pull out each key into a variable
and then

48
00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.420
use it to display the value that's
associated with the key.

49
00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.030
So with that we're ready to move to the
last lesson in this

50
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.140
chapter, and we're going to discuss how to
use for loops with files.
