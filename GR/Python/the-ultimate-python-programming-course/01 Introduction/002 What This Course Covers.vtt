1
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.990
Hello and welcome to this course on

2
00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.610
Python programming called Introduction to
Python Programming.

3
00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.950
My name is Mike McMillan and I'm going to
be your instructor for the course.

4
00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.100
To tell you a little bit about myself,
I've been

5
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.700
a college instructor of computer science
for the past 13 years.

6
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.805
I've taught courses in programming
languages such as

7
00:00:19.805 --> 00:00:27.250
C++, Java, Visual Basic, JavaScript, C#,
PHP, and Python.

8
00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.660
I've been a programmer, though, for the
past 23 years,

9
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.030
and have worked in the industry, off and
on, since 1981.

10
00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.120
In this course, we're going to cover the
basics of Python

11
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.710
Programming for a person who has no
experience at all in programming.

12
00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.390
So, to give you an idea of the topics
we're going to be covering in the course,

13
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.850
I'm just gonna list them out for you right

14
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.740
here, we'll be talking about how to
install Python.

15
00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.410
We'll write our very first program, our
Hello, World!

16
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.050
program, as a way of introducing you to
the

17
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.780
basics of entering a program and getting
it to run.

18
00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.900
Next, we'll talk about the different data

19
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.950
types and how to create variables in
python.

20
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.230
Next, we'll talk about python input and
output.

21
00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.460
next, we'll be talking about how to get
our programs

22
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.100
to make decisions, and that's how to
create if statements.

23
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.280
Next up, we'll learn how to perform
repetition in

24
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.660
our python programs, and that topic is
while loops.

25
00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.950
Staying on the topic of repetition, we'll
talk

26
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.000
about the loop type which is for loops.

27
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.620
Then we'll talk about a little more
advanced topic that is key to

28
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.640
performing a lot of repetition in Python,
and that's the concept of the iterator.

29
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.230
Next, we'll talk about what are called
list comprehensions.

30
00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.820
After list comprehensions, we'll be
talking about how

31
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.740
to create and use functions in our Python
program.

32
00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.950
Following functions, we'll talk a little
bit about variable scope.

33
00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.850
And how variables are perceived in our
Python program.

34
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.850
Next, we'll talk about how to create
modules and how

35
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.300
to use the built-in modules that come with
the Python language.

36
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.270
After that, we'll talk about the

37
00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.100
basics of creating objects, and
object-oriented programming.

38
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.620
Following the basics of object-oriented
programming,

39
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.990
we'll talk about one advanced
object-oriented

40
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.740
programming topic, and that's inheritance,
or

41
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.970
reusing class definitions in other class
definitions.

42
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.570
Then, we'll talk about exception handling
and how to handle.

43
00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.910
Exceptions or errors in our Python
program.

44
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.850
Finally, to wrap up the course we'll have
a little chapter on using data structures,

45
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.600
and these data structures include lists,
tuples, and dictionaries.

46
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.790
I believe the topics we cover in this
course will give you

47
00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.970
a good beginning foundation to becoming

48
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.410
a competent, and even expert Python
programmer.

49
00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.370
Once you finish this course, I'd encourage
you to look at another

50
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.090
course that I've created for Infinite

51
00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.870
Skills, called Web Programming with
Python.

52
00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.730
In it, you'll learn how to use Python to
do lots of different types of web

53
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.170
programming from screen scraping to
creating your own

54
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.870
web applications platforms using a system
called Django.

55
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.220
But web programming is a completely other
topic

56
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.770
and here we're talking about just
introductory Python programming.

57
00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.700
So, without further ado I encourage you to
move onto the first chapter of

58
00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.480
the course where we talk about how to
install Python on your computer system.
