1
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.050
In this lesson I'm gonna show you how to
install

2
00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:06.510
Python on a Windows PC, and it's really
quite simple.

3
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.020
The first thing we're gonna do is open

4
00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:16.270
a browser and navigate over to Python.org,
or www.python.org.

5
00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:17.580
Select the download link.

6
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.760
Scroll down just a bit, and you'll see we
have a Python 2.7.2 Windows installer.

7
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.430
That's one we're going to install.

8
00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.294
We're also going to install the Python
3.2.2 installer only

9
00:00:31.294 --> 00:00:35.010
because we're going to use two different
versions of Python.

10
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.930
Python 3 at the beginning for our
introductory lessons or

11
00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.530
our review of Python, and then Python 2.7
for some

12
00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.210
of the more specialized web apps, only
because not all

13
00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.060
of the libraries work with this newer
version of Python.

14
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.860
So I'm gonna demonstrate how to install
2.7.2 or just Python 2.7,

15
00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.070
and from that, you download the other
version exactly the same way.

16
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.810
So click on the installer.

17
00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.420
Ask you if you want to save the file; say
yes.

18
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.130
Take this a few minutes or a few seconds
to do that, not very long, there we go.

19
00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.700
So we're gonna double click this file.

20
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.870
Let's remove the old version.

21
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.640
Now begins the process, and again, you
don't have

22
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.859
to do this, if you don't have Python
installed initially.

23
00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.470
But I do, and because I want to do it

24
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.870
orderly, I want to remove it correctly
before I re-install it.

25
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.300
And it's always worthwhile knowing how to
uninstall software, just as it is to

26
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.080
know how to install it because at some
point you may need to uninstall.

27
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.130
You need to see how that process takes
place.

28
00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.480
[BLANK_AUDIO].

29
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.160
Now if we double click again, here comes
the installation process.

30
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.930
So it asks us where we want to put our
files.

31
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:49.930
We'll say Python 27.

32
00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.750
That's the standard.

33
00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.060
You won't see this if you don't have
Python already installed.

34
00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.640
Other than that its exactly the same.

35
00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.140
So

36
00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.680
now we begin another hurry up and wait
process.

37
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.550
Click Finish.

38
00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.490
You can clear this list or just close the
downloads window.

39
00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.600
Now let's bring up a command prompt
window.

40
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.785
Navigate over to Python 27.

41
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.720
Lets run a little test program.

42
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.120
Were going to call this hello world .py.

43
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.400
Python programs have to have a py
extension.

44
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.900
And

45
00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.460
all we're going to do is display hello
world on the screen.

46
00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.220
So we'll do it just like so.

47
00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.350
So it's print open parent, open quote,
hello

48
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.040
comma world, exclamation point, close
quote, close parent.

49
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.880
Save and exit.

50
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:52.691
And then to run it, you're gonna type
Python hello world py.

51
00:02:52.691 --> 00:02:56.950
And if hello world appears on your screen
as it did on mine, then everything

52
00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.660
is successful, if not, uninstall and
reinstall,

53
00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.820
but you should not have had any problem.

54
00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.520
So that wraps up this lesson on installing
Python.

55
00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.480
Remember, you also wanna go back and
install Python 3,

56
00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.210
although you can follow my instructions
with Python 27, also.

57
00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.260
But after you've done that, you're ready
to move

58
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.370
to the next lesson where we discuss the
Python interpreter.
