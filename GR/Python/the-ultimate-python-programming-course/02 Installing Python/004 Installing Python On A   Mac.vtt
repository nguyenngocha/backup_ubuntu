00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:05.720
In this lesson, I'm going to discuss how
to install python on Macintosh.

2
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.290
So the first thing we're gonna do, is

3
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.560
go to the python webpage which is
www.python.org.

4
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.340
We're going to select Download, and we're
going to scroll down

5
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.100
and look for the macintosh version, the OS
TN 64 bit.

6
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.200
Then we begin the download process.

7
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.420
That'll take just a moment.

8
00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.080
The next step now, is to install the
package.

9
00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:30.505
There it is right there.

10
00:00:30.505 --> 00:00:34.510
Double-click and just follow through with
the defaults on the installer.

11
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.120
Your system will ask you for a password.

12
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:45.760
Type that in.

13
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.190
Now, we wait while it installs.

14
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:52.950
Click close here.

15
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:53.960
Close these windows.

16
00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.310
Have a terminal window open, and what
we're going to do is write a test program.

17
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.801
I'm going to use VI and type
pillowworld.py.

18
00:01:02.801 --> 00:01:06.620
We're going to do a simple hello world
program right here we're going to type

19
00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:13.220
print, hello world, save the file so
that's a W Q Cmd

20
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.520
and then type Python helloworld.py,

21
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.980
shows Hello World, and so we can see that
Python is installed correctly.

22
00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.620
And we're finished with the installation
and we're

23
00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.190
ready to move on to the next lesson.
