1
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:03.250
In this chapter we're going to discuss a
very

2
00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:07.550
simple process, how to enter and run
programs in Python.

3
00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.585
We're gonna do it in this lesson for
Windows

4
00:00:09.585 --> 00:00:12.410
environment and then in the next lesson on
the Mac.

5
00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.710
These are very short lessons just to
demonstrate exactly what you have to

6
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.490
do to type in a Python program and then
get it to run.

7
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.610
We haven't learned much Python program
yet.

8
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.040
In fact, we haven't learned any Python
programming.

9
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.020
So we're going to keep it simple and

10
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.740
we're going to do the classic Hello World
program.

11
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.520
So all this program is going to do

12
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.270
is display the phrase, Hello World, to the
screen.

13
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.240
So the first thing you need to do is bring
up a command prompt window.

14
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.690
I'll be doing all my work in the command
prompt.

15
00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.840
So if you're not comfortable with that,
spend a little bit

16
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.540
of extra time learning to get comfortable
with the command prompt.

17
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.470
So when you open a command prompt window,

18
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.650
it'll take you to your user's user name
sub-directory.

19
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.440
I've already change directories to
documents.

20
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.740
Let me go back and show you what that

21
00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.850
looks like, just in case you've never seen
it before.

22
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.390
So when you open a command prompt window
in Windows, you see this.

23
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.745
Then you type cd documents to take you to
your documents folder.

24
00:01:07.745 --> 00:01:09.660
I'm showing you that because I am gonna
show you in

25
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.960
a minute, how to write Python programs
from inside this directory.

26
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.250
We are actually gonna create another
directory.

27
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.830
But first, we are gonna see how to do it
from the python directory.

28
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.316
So, we are gonna change to python.

29
00:01:22.316 --> 00:01:29.400
So you type cdbackslashpython30 and that
takes you to the Python 30 sub-directory.

30
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.300
So, we clear the screen.

31
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.800
And

32
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.310
we're gonna type notepad helloworld.py.

33
00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.470
Now, it's very important that you add the
.py

34
00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.000
extension because that's how the Python
interpreter knows that the.

35
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.520
File you're trying to load and run is a
Python program.

36
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.250
It's by having that .py extension.

37
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.320
So enter that and that will bring up this
window.

38
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.900
Now I already have it here, so I'm going
to erase it

39
00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.560
and write it again, although that's not
really the point of this lesson.

40
00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.940
We'll be learning all about these commands
later.

41
00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.160
So, we wanna print hello world to screen,

42
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.070
so we type print and then an open
parenthesis.

43
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.480
Print is a function that requires
parenthesis.

44
00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.730
Then, we can either use a double quote or
a single quote.

45
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.040
We'll use double quotes this time and
then,

46
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.560
so we surround the phrase hello world in
quotes.

47
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.560
And then add a second parenthesis to

48
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.350
close the print function argument, and
that's it.

49
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.990
That's the whole program, so click File >
Exit, then it'll ask you to save,

50
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:36.600
and you click Yes, or Save, and that takes
us back to the Command Prompt window.

51
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.688
We can type Python.

52
00:02:38.688 --> 00:02:42.780
Hello world.py and then that will display
hello world

53
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.255
on the screen or because the operating
system recognizes

54
00:02:47.255 --> 00:02:50.760
py extensions as Python programs, you can
just type

55
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.060
hello world.py and it will automatically
run the python interpreter.

56
00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.390
So that's how you run a program, or
script, from the command line.

57
00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.040
That's one way to do it.

58
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.590
Another way to do it, is to go back to
your documents folder.

59
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.990
So type, cd backslash, users backslash,
your username backslash, documents.

60
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.185
And then we're going to create a
sub-directory.

61
00:03:14.185 --> 00:03:17.550
Mine already exist, but just type md
python.

62
00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.230
Then you can change into the Python

63
00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.590
directory and now you have a sub-directory
for

64
00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.640
your Python programs in your documents
folder which

65
00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.852
is often a handy place to keep everything.

66
00:03:28.852 --> 00:03:32.520
You oughta have a back up program that
looks in your documents folder to back

67
00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.150
things up for whatever reason, it's
convenient to

68
00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.550
have programs like this in your documents
folder.

69
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.550
So now we can go through the same process
again.

70
00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.700
And again, I've already done it so here's
my program.

71
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:45.806
Don't need a semicolon.

72
00:03:45.806 --> 00:03:50.474
Then click File > Exit > Save.

73
00:03:50.474 --> 00:03:54.660
And then once again, helloworld.py.

74
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.600
And we can do that because the Python
sub-directory

75
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.380
link to the interpreter is in our system
path.

76
00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.150
If I type the past statement right here,
if

77
00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.429
you scroll way down, look way down, you'll
see c,

78
00:04:06.429 --> 00:04:11.260
colon, backslash,python30, I also have an
older python sub-directory

79
00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.570
in my path, and that's how I can find it.

80
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:14.070
You

81
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:21.660
could also type the long way, python
helloworld.py.

82
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.520
And get the same result.

83
00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.680
So in a nutshell that's how you enter and
run programs in Python.

84
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.210
We'll be doing this quite a bit more

85
00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.420
throughout the course so you'll get very,
very familiar

86
00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.560
with it, but it's always nice to see at

87
00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.798
the beginning exactly how to get a program
running.

88
00:04:37.798 --> 00:04:39.675
So I've shown you how to do it from the
Python

89
00:04:39.675 --> 00:04:45.130
sub-directory, and by creating a Python
directory in your documents folder.

90
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:46.950
Either way it's fine with me.

91
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:52.760
I will probably now work from this users
nmcmillan documents Python directory, just

92
00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.570
so I can keep all my scripts in one easy
to find place.

93
00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.930
So that wraps up this lesson, and the next
lesson

94
00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.660
is on how to run programs in the Mac
environment.

95
00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.430
If you don't have a Mac, you can skip on
to the exercise.

96
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.470
Otherwise, I'll see you in the next lesson
on working with a Mac.
