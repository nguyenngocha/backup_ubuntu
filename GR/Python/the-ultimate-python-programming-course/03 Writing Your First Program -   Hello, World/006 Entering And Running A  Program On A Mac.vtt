00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:05.160
In this lesson we're going to learn how to
run Python programs on a Macintosh.

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.760
So the first thing you need to do is open
up a terminal window.

3
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.750
You can get to the terminal program from
your utilities folder.

4
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.880
And the first thing we're going to do is
work with the interactive shell.

5
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.140
So to get to the interactive shell, we
just type Python, that opens the shell.

6
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.420
Now let's run a quick command, print hello
world.

7
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.060
Actually a function, and there's hello
world.

8
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.050
So now let's exit the shell and let's

9
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.580
see how to enter programs using the Pico
Editor.

10
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.810
So type pico, followed by the name of your
program.

11
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.330
In this case it's going to be hellow.py.

12
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.400
Now type in the program, now type
Control-X,

13
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.810
then a Y to save, and then the file name
is as we wanted it, so just hit enter.

14
00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:01.200
Now type Python, and the name of the file,
and that runs the program.

15
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.310
Let's open it up again and make a little
change, let's add a little more code this

16
00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.630
time we're gonna write a for loop that
displays hello world 10 times.

17
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.260
So we'll finish typing in print hello
world, then

18
00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.430
save in the same manner that we did
before,

19
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:22.488
now run it again,

20
00:01:22.488 --> 00:01:24.992
[BLANK_AUDIO]

21
00:01:24.992 --> 00:01:28.100
and you'll see that it works just fine.

22
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.880
I'll be showing you most of the lessons on
the Windows machine, but

23
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.380
this is how you're going to do it if you
use a Macintosh.

24
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.810
And with that we've completed this lesson.
